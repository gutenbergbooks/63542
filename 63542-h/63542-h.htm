<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="antiqua">Preface</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="center">By the Author.</p>


<p>This poem that I have dignified with the
term epic, was written by inspiration, and
is dedicated to the human race. I have used
the term epic with no intention of assuming
a dignity not due my production; but,
in the sense that the precepts and warnings
contained therein, have a lofty purpose; and
are graphically set forth in the plainest
words in the English language.</p>

<p>I have not indulged in similes or hyperboles;
nor does my epic abound with those
picturesque figures of comparison found in
Homer or Virgil, nor those cadences and
swells found in The Paradise Lost, describing
the headlong falls and gigantic flights
of those god-like personages peopling the
heavens and earth in the poetic mind; nor
does my inspiration come from muse or divine
breath; nor did it descend upon me
from above; on the contrary, it sprang up
out of the deep feeling I have for my kind,
especially those in the strained walks of
life.</p>

<p>Our twentieth century shows society in
the process of centralizing itself; and, gradually
forcing us into legal socialism. This<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
is plainly shown in the poem. The process
of centralization, for years, worked slowly
in this country. As long as the influence of
the founders of our Republic was potent,
liberty was dominant.</p>

<p>The first step in this process was the inauguration
of a general system of free public
schools. The direct result of this free
education was to overcrowd the book and
head portion of our population at the expense
of the producing classes, making it
harder for the clerk to make a bare living.
The idea of every parent now seems to be
that his or her offspring is especially adapted
to the learned professions and to society.</p>

<p>This was also the first step towards the
diversion of public funds to private enterprise.
The appropriation of public moneys
to the extensive and widening fields of private
affairs has progressed rapidly in the
last decade. This, with its evils, is vividly
set forth in my poem. Unless this is
checked by united, immediate action, socialism
will increase more rapidly in the future
than in the past, is my prophecy. This results
from the fact that the tax-eaters are
the ones who manipulate our bond elections.</p>

<p>The result is plain, and can be predicted
with certainty; the end of socialism will be
the extreme opposite and, that you all know<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
is anarchy. When everything is so striking
that nothing strikes, or in other words,
when there are more laws than we can possibly
tolerate, we&#8217;ll naturally rebel and kick
them all over; all, as shown in this epic.
The last transition will likely be accomplished
by bloodshed and strife.</p>

<p>The laws for the management of society
in a state of complete legal socialism will be
so numerous and complicated; and the
bureaus so haughty and domineering that
freemen will not try to learn them, much
less obey them. In fact, no one can now
keep pace with the rapid production of
laws under our incipient socialism. The
fight I make is to break off now and go back
to fundamentals, as shown in my poem.</p>

<p>As against socialism or anarchy I deliberately
prefer the latter; but, as against
both of them I prefer a government of limited
powers, based exclusively on natural
laws that I have so forcibly defined in this
work; with a complete abandonment of the
barbarous idea of punishment for crimes by
criminal courts; the man who commits a
crime is to be pitied and helped to a more
sane mode of existence, and not be driven
into perpetual criminality. As to how he
shall be handled can be better settled when
we clear ourselves of our false notions on
the subject.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>Our legal servants, we call officers, are
now deteriorating with great rapidity, as
set forth in this poem under &#8220;Names.&#8221; My
remedy for that is to cut down the salaries
of all officers from President down, so low
that no one will seek office for money.
Then have the laws such that men will be
selected and compelled to serve, by public
sentiment, for short terms and take out part
of their pay in patriotism and good will.</p>

<p>My observation, over a number of years,
shows that the higher the salary, the more
inefficient the officer. High salaries also
give birth to gangs of politicians who fatten
off the public funds and salaries of
their appointees, making graft semi-respectable.</p>

<p>Honesty in public and private life seems
to me to be very desirable; and, it could be
so easily attained, as set forth in my epic.
Of course, under our prevailing system,
honesty is out of the question; and if any
of you think that I have not convicted you
of dishonesty, as defined under that topic,
please send me your photograph to be used
herein.</p>

<p>In writing this poem I have no malice in
my heart for a single human being on
earth; and, if in any way I have touched
upon any of your pet notions or sacred
ideas, and thereby wounded your feelings,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
I sincerely ask your forgiveness; with me
all truth is sacred. I have no ill-will
against preachers, lawyers, or doctors; I
wrote you up to make you think, and also
to let you know you were not fooling me.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I say to you one and all,
as brothers and fellow citizens, let&#8217;s work
together to save the greatest country and
the greatest civilization on earth.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse">Let truth together bind us,</div>
<div class="verse">And supporting it find us.</div>

<div class="verse">I never shall appeal to any muse of old</div>

<div class="verse">Tell you what I know that you may truly scan</div>

<div class="verse">On every working day, when your labor&#8217;s done.</div>
<div class="verse">In telling where to go I will not name the place</div>
<div class="verse">Where you should show your face, but let each run his race</div>
<div class="verse">And, for himself decide the spot to cast his lot.</div>
<div class="verse">I&#8217;ll point out mistakes to help put on brakes</div>

<div class="verse">And regulations new that men had little to do</div>

<div class="verse">Developments in science where we place reliance</div>
<div class="verse">To alleviate the misdirection of our state</div>

<div class="verse">Wars, with all their frightful havoc spread</div>

<div class="verse">And peace too that came at last</div>
<div class="verse">That o&#8217;er the earth its healing blessings amassed</div>
<div class="verse">Should have a place when in plates my work is cast;</div>
<div class="verse">Also ethics, that practical theme so misunderstood,</div>
<div class="verse">Should here be elucidated for the general good;</div>
<div class="verse">And a few short digressions would not be out of place</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
<div class="verse">In an Epic dedicated to and written for The Human Race.</div>

<div class="verse">Because he published that T. R. had been drunk.</div>
<div class="verse">To tell the names of men who are shams in our times</div>

<div class="verse">They&#8217;d have our laws, judges and courts recalled,</div>

<div class="verse">They&#8217;d regulate the wages men have to pay,</div>
<div class="verse">Neglecting to tell the laborer he might be in the way</div>
<div class="verse">Unless his work he did should his employers pay;</div>
<div class="verse">For unless his production his pay did compensate</div>
<div class="verse">He and others would soon be off the slate.</div>
<div class="verse">They told us too in tones as loud as they could prate</div>
<div class="verse">How all the monied men and trusts they&#8217;d regulate,</div>
<div class="verse">Carefully hiding the man who was running their slate,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
<div class="verse">And supplying the funds for them to navigate.</div>
<div class="verse">The working man too his dinner pail they&#8217;d fill</div>
<div class="verse">Forgetting also to tell him to send in his bill.</div>
<div class="verse">They&#8217;d secure to all the women free right to vote,</div>
<div class="verse">So they could say to hubby: &#8220;We&#8217;ve got your goat.&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">And volumes of such ideas upon us did they float</div>
<div class="verse">All too numerous in this article to quote.</div>
<div class="verse">Drop your silly custom not worn off by growth</div>
<div class="verse">That judicial bodies must put a witness to oath,</div>
<div class="verse">That all he says and all that he shall quote</div>
<div class="verse">Will be the truth and nothing but the truth,</div>
<div class="verse">About the matters he relates in his witness booth.</div>
<div class="verse">The reasons for this habit have long passed forsooth,</div>
<div class="verse">It deceives none on bench or in jury box;</div>
<div class="verse">It may occasionally aid some old, designing fox</div>
<div class="verse">To some youthful, verdant judge deceive</div>
<div class="verse">And, of some just debt himself relieve.</div>
<div class="verse">On the whole, it does more harm than good</div>
<div class="verse">As at present the thing is generally understood:</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
<div class="verse">For in a contested suit with one who knows</div>
<div class="verse">Against a trembly one who partially shows</div>
<div class="verse">Some lingering faith in &#8220;Old Scare Crows,&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">The inclination to lie and deceive in the one</div>
<div class="verse">Would surely be by the other simply outdone:</div>
<div class="verse">The one might be bound by the fears of hell</div>
<div class="verse">While the other swears away his lies to tell.</div>
<div class="verse">When the witness swears he&#8217;s perjured unawares,</div>
<div class="verse">For by his plight he must the whole truth reveal</div>
<div class="verse">By the rule he must more than half conceal.</div>
<div class="verse">Stop your fight for prohibition and do the fair thing;</div>
<div class="verse">Our people to temperance themselves will shortly bring.</div>
<div class="verse">Take taxes off whisky, wine, liquor and beer;</div>
<div class="verse">And, for the cause of temperance you needn&#8217;t have a fear.</div>
<div class="verse">Let all your marts and markets freely sell</div>
<div class="verse">Every kind of liquor they ever heard tell;</div>
<div class="verse">Let every one the stuff make from gulf to lake;</div>
<div class="verse">Make the price so cheap that with one leap,</div>
<div class="verse">Men will forsake the common thing to keep.</div>
<div class="verse">At one cent a drink the bar keeper will think</div>
<div class="verse">His saloon will sink and soon put him on the brink</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
<div class="verse">Of finding some other way all his expenses to pay;</div>
<div class="verse">So out soon he goes not stopping his doors to close.</div>
<div class="verse">There still will be drinking and that keeps you thinking,</div>
<div class="verse">That by compulsion you can create a revulsion</div>
<div class="verse">In the taste of man heap sooner than you can.</div>
<div class="verse">The truth is, you&#8217;ve always tried in vain</div>
<div class="verse">All these cultivated tastes of man to restrain.</div>
<div class="verse">The more you try to force men good habits to acquire,</div>
<div class="verse">The more you stir up and increase his raging desire,</div>
<div class="verse">To show his freedom against which you conspire.</div>
<div class="verse">He&#8217;ll go to any extent which you&#8217;ll never prevent,</div>
<div class="verse">To get his booze on which his mind is bent;</div>
<div class="verse">He&#8217;ll keep his &#8220;blind tigers&#8221; and his wooden legs,</div>
<div class="verse">Hollowed out and neatly made with faucet of pegs,</div>
<div class="verse">His whisky he&#8217;ll conceal and feel he&#8217;s in the right;</div>
<div class="verse">So you&#8217;ll not stop him no matter how you fight.</div>
<div class="verse">The drunkard will drink no matter what you think,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
<div class="verse">At any cost no matter if you consider him lost.</div>
<div class="verse">Make the price so cheap that for his family&#8217;s keep,</div>
<div class="verse">He&#8217;ll still be ahead to buy his folks their bread.</div>

<div class="verse">I used to tell my friends what I was going to do,</div>

<div class="verse">I know of once or twice by taking their advice,</div>
<div class="verse">A good deal I lost at a distressing cost.</div>
<div class="verse">Take my advice; choose your own course to pursue,</div>
<div class="verse">And, when you get your plan, just put it through,</div>
<div class="verse">And then tell no other man what you&#8217;ve been up to.</div>
<div class="verse">Then if you succeed you will never need,</div>
<div class="verse">Anybody else to claim part of your deed.</div>
<div class="verse">Even if you fail, don&#8217;t furl up your sail</div>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Listen to this story about a little girl,</div>
<div class="verse">Who came into the world a short time ago.</div>
<div class="verse">I remember the day, only a few months or so;</div>
<div class="verse">It was in the month of March over a year;</div>
<div class="verse">When all trembling with hope and fear,</div>
<div class="verse">We did for her watch&mdash;all sincere.</div>
<div class="verse">At night she came, and without any name,</div>
<div class="verse">Because we did not know what her sex would be;</div>
<div class="verse">But at her scream, the doctor said &#8220;she&#8221;;</div>
<div class="verse">And, then, we all at once knew what to do;</div>
<div class="verse">About naming her the course to pursue.</div>
<div class="verse">We left it to her mother, herself a little bride,</div>
<div class="verse">This weighty matter of naming all to decide.</div>
<div class="verse">We told her all the names we did hear or see,</div>
<div class="verse">But she rejected them all and called her Dorothy.</div>
<div class="verse">So Dorothy&#8217;s my theme her grandmother&#8217;s dream,</div>
<div class="verse">During all those years when those babes of hers,</div>
<div class="verse">Us did come to see, and, now she still avers,</div>
<div class="verse">That she watched through the passing years</div>
<div class="verse">Looking to see if one of hers a girl might be,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
<div class="verse">But they were boys, the whole blessed three.</div>
<div class="verse">Now Dorothy&#8217;s here to fill our home with cheer</div>
<div class="verse">By her little, prattling talk and her shambling walk,</div>
<div class="verse">By her little tricks she plays in her winning ways,</div>
<div class="verse">Pulling off your hat and fumbling your cravat,</div>
<div class="verse">Knocking over chairs, trying to go upstairs,</div>
<div class="verse">Picking all the flowers for grandpa to smell,</div>
<div class="verse">And more other things than tongue or pen can tell.</div>
<div class="verse">She&#8217;s a little sprite and good for our sight.</div>
<div class="verse">But here I must pause and sadly say,</div>
<div class="verse">That one evil day a swelling came on her neck,</div>
<div class="verse">We thought for sure had come from us to take</div>
<div class="verse">The little brat, and all our hearts to break.</div>
<div class="verse">But the good doctor came and now she&#8217;s the same</div>
<div class="verse">As she was before the blasted swelling came.</div>
<div class="verse">May I never see the day till my race on earth is run</div>
<div class="verse">When any evil at all shall befall this little one.</div>
<div class="verse">Many of you have plenty of such chaps,</div>
<div class="verse">That jump up and down upon your laps,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
<div class="verse">Who are just as pretty and just as sweet;</div>
<div class="verse">And you walk with them upon the street,</div>
<div class="verse">To the market and to the drug store,</div>
<div class="verse">Where you buy food stuffs for them galore,</div>
<div class="verse">Just the same as I do for mine o&#8217;er and o&#8217;er.</div>
<div class="verse">But still with me a great difference I see,</div>
<div class="verse">Between your brats and my Dorothy,</div>
<div class="verse">And the reason that you do not with me agree</div>
<div class="verse">Is simply because you are you and I am me.</div>

<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="antiqua">Divorce</span></h2>
</div>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Now drop a little tear, but don&#8217;t stop here,</div>
<div class="verse">Come along now and let&#8217;s see if we can agree</div>
<div class="verse">Upon another matter while o&#8217;er the thing I scatter</div>
<div class="verse">Some thoughts I have, not intending myself to flatter.</div>
<div class="verse">Divorce is a question about which many disagree;</div>
<div class="verse">Some think it&#8217;s wrong; some think it&#8217;s right maybe.</div>
<div class="verse">Now upon it let&#8217;s begin our wordy fight and see.</div>
<div class="verse">For a beginning I will postulate, simply to open the debate,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
<div class="verse">That it is not an affair of the state that couples separate,</div>
<div class="verse">When they each other fervently hate;</div>
<div class="verse">Except where children, a care about whose fate,</div>
<div class="verse">On the conscience of the public might grate,</div>
<div class="verse">Are brought into court for the judge to state</div>
<div class="verse">In his judicial opinion of the case,</div>
<div class="verse">What he considers best for the human race.</div>
<div class="verse">Then of course if His Honor is wise, he&#8217;ll devise</div>
<div class="verse">Some plan to make wife and man either realize,</div>
<div class="verse">That if they are deaf to the cries of their offspring</div>
<div class="verse">The court itself will bring pressure into the thing</div>
<div class="verse">They&#8217;re about to do, and, before it gets through,</div>
<div class="verse">I think that neither me nor you will any suggestion make</div>
<div class="verse">Or advice give about what course the law will take.</div>
<div class="verse">If when all this is done and the court can&#8217;t make them one,</div>
<div class="verse">Then it is up to him and all my talk is done.</div>
<div class="verse">Some people oppose divorce on account of their views,</div>
<div class="verse">Acquired from that book written by ancient Jews.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
<div class="verse">Some think it a disgrace upon the entire human race,</div>
<div class="verse">For any sundered couples to have a place,</div>
<div class="verse">On the green earth where they may show their face.</div>
<div class="verse">This narrow view is not entertained by you or me,</div>
<div class="verse">Because we&#8217;ve been along far enough to see</div>
<div class="verse">Some of the things from whom some are set free.</div>
<div class="verse">Others oppose it on the score of &#8220;I told you so!</div>
<div class="verse">People oughtn&#8217;t marry whom they did not know.&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">Some plunge deep into the matter, themselves they flatter,</div>
<div class="verse">That they can some great big principles scatter,</div>
<div class="verse">Over the very causes while they chatter.</div>
<div class="verse">They&#8217;d take it in time and let the big state</div>
<div class="verse">Issue its own red-sealed certificate,</div>
<div class="verse">To all spooning couples longing to mate,</div>
<div class="verse">And, at one single throw the entire nuisance abate.</div>
<div class="verse">Then these smart ones pucker their mouth,</div>
<div class="verse">With their heads tossed north and south,</div>
<div class="verse">To see if anybody should really act so shoddy,</div>
<div class="verse">As not an acquiescent head to at once noddy.</div>
<div class="verse">But the main fight does not come from home,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
<div class="verse">It thunders from the pope of Rome;</div>
<div class="verse">And, there are plenty of folks take his word home.</div>
<div class="verse">He says marriage is the sacred thing of life,</div>
<div class="verse">And when one takes a wife, regardless of strife,</div>
<div class="verse">They cannot be cut apart with a butcher&#8217;s knife.</div>
<div class="verse">So you may shake this subject up and down,</div>
<div class="verse">In country, village and town, and use every noun,</div>
<div class="verse">Verb, adverb and pronoun from early morn to sundown,</div>
<div class="verse">And the people will no better be made, for all your</div>
<div class="verse">Prattle and all you said.</div>
<div class="verse">The real causes of the thing are ingrain,</div>
<div class="verse">Born in the heart and born in the brain,</div>
<div class="verse">Maybe, by any by, before you die, but not I,</div>
<div class="verse">Science may teach us to create and the race propagate,</div>
<div class="verse">In some other way besides this vexing marriage state.</div>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">The next subject allied the last, on to which</div>
<div class="verse">I have been trying my train of thoughts to switch,</div>
<div class="verse">Is one to which a common word is applied,</div>
<div class="verse">That just as well fits many other things beside;</div>
<div class="verse">But the meaning of which comes easily when tried;</div>
<div class="verse">And seems to pop into your heads with no upheaval,</div>
<div class="verse">Is that natural crime called &#8220;the social evil.&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">Now, I did not make people and neither did you,</div>
<div class="verse">But if a certain inspired book be true,</div>
<div class="verse">Some one made man for a start,</div>
<div class="verse">And then chopped out him a piece near his heart,</div>
<div class="verse">And constructed another of a little different sort.</div>
<div class="verse">If this be true the &#8220;some one&#8221; must be divinity</div>
<div class="verse">For, ever since, there has been a mysterious affinity,</div>
<div class="verse">Between the two kinds in every community.</div>
<div class="verse">On this subject we must not too widely roam,</div>
<div class="verse">Because it might bring some trouble home,</div>
<div class="verse">To some of you married men who every now and then</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
<div class="verse">Feel like jumping out of your own pen.</div>
<div class="verse">Legislation and investigation and even humiliation,</div>
<div class="verse">Over all creation, in homes of every station,</div>
<div class="verse">Among peoples of every tribe and nation,</div>
<div class="verse">Have to this offense brought emancipation.</div>
<div class="verse">Women have been burned at the stake,</div>
<div class="verse">In attempting to make them forsake,</div>
<div class="verse">The lives they were leading, the men they were bleeding.</div>
<div class="verse">In all your statute books, in corners and nooks,</div>
<div class="verse">Laws have been framed against every thing that looks</div>
<div class="verse">Towards countenancing any form of prostitution:</div>
<div class="verse">Yet with all this and your contribution,</div>
<div class="verse">In your vain attempts to revise the constitution</div>
<div class="verse">Of woman and man ever since the world began,</div>
<div class="verse">You have not yet laid the foundation</div>
<div class="verse">For killing this wicked institution.</div>
<div class="verse">You have tried segregation into dark streets,</div>
<div class="verse">Where your own policemen lose their beats;</div>
<div class="verse">You have tried fines in the police courts,</div>
<div class="verse">Where they fetch up all the regular sports;</div>
<div class="verse">You have even gone yourself among the slums;</div>
<div class="verse">And feigned to be treating them as your chums,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
<div class="verse">Doing your levelest to put them under your thumbs,</div>
<div class="verse">And yet this evil does not seem to succumb;</div>
<div class="verse">Now what can we do but to stop trying,</div>
<div class="verse">And to our several good wives lying</div>
<div class="verse">About where we&#8217;ve been now and then.</div>
<div class="verse">You let this subject alone and stay at home</div>
<div class="verse">As much as you can for the good of man.</div>
<div class="verse">The more you talk and act wise,</div>
<div class="verse">The more you&#8217;ll advertise the thing to eyes</div>

<div class="verse">As my train of thought rumbled over the</div>

<div class="verse">Even the little that I know and the facts show</div>
<div class="verse">About woman suffrage more than you already know.</div>
<div class="verse">Because I once rode with Phoebe Cousins</div>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">If in all your acquaintance, you know an honest man,</div>
<div class="verse">Produce him and introduce him to me if you can,</div>
<div class="verse">That I may get the likeness of his face</div>
<div class="verse">To emboss in gold for a model to the human race;</div>
<div class="verse">In my epic I&#8217;ll give him a prominent place.</div>
<div class="verse">Now, don&#8217;t get miffed at me, till my meaning you see</div>
<div class="verse">And my definition you fully understand of honesty.</div>
<div class="verse">I can find plenty of people anywhere</div>

<div class="verse">And get into trouble if the same he&#8217;d find.</div>
<div class="verse">Of all the animals on earth we find anywhere</div>
<div class="verse">Man&#8217;s the only dishonest one I do declare,</div>
<div class="verse">Unless the fox be called dishonest when to lead</div>
<div class="verse">The howling pack off his track, he runs at full speed,</div>
<div class="verse">And turns around and comes back over the same track</div>
<div class="verse">And then quickly darts off somewhere to hide,</div>
<div class="verse">While the hounds on the old straight track relied,</div>
<div class="verse">And bound ahead beyond where the fox turned back,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
<div class="verse">Thinking he&#8217;s gone on and thus lose the track.</div>
<div class="verse">This clever deceit is accomplished so neat,</div>
<div class="verse">By the sly little fox who is hard to beat.</div>
<div class="verse">You may take the meanest horse any day,</div>
<div class="verse">While munching away on his bale of hay,</div>
<div class="verse">And he&#8217;ll kick, bite, and run all the others away,</div>
<div class="verse">Until he gets his belly full, when he leaves</div>
<div class="verse">And lets the others eat the rest of the sheaves;</div>
<div class="verse">And doesn&#8217;t lock them up in a safety deposit box.</div>
<div class="verse">When a man&#8217;s wants are supplied, he locks</div>
<div class="verse">Up from all others the things he cannot use,</div>
<div class="verse">If he lived a thousand years his stomach to abuse.</div>
<div class="verse">Civilization made us dishonest, nature never did;</div>
<div class="verse">Deceit comes from cultivation and we&#8217;ll never rid</div>
<div class="verse">Ourselves from its blighting evils till we undo</div>
<div class="verse">Many of our laws and customs made and passed by you.</div>
<div class="verse">Man could be made honest in a very few years,</div>
<div class="verse">If he could be held respectable among his peers;</div>
<div class="verse">But if one of us should get honest all at once,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
<div class="verse">We&#8217;d be hauled up for being a dunce;</div>
<div class="verse">And, an inquisition had to ascertain whether we&#8217;re mad.</div>
<div class="verse">Our behavior would to others seem so queer,</div>
<div class="verse">That they would flee from us in bodily fear.</div>
<div class="verse">So we will have to let reformation work slow,</div>
<div class="verse">Until the full meaning of my epic you know.</div>

</div>

<p class="center">(A Digression.)</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">A certain man, stout and medium tall</div>
<div class="verse">Dwelt near us once, named Jim Saltenstall.</div>
<div class="verse">The most peculiar thing about this man,</div>
<div class="verse">Was not his name nor distended span.</div>
<div class="verse">A powerful limb was he of the law,</div>
<div class="verse">In which he exercised his massive jaw,</div>
<div class="verse">In justice courts if chance he saw,</div>
<div class="verse">To display his wit or pick a flaw,</div>
<div class="verse">In some contention neighbors hate,</div>
<div class="verse">Where he was ready and never too late,</div>
<div class="verse">To get a V for his windy prate.</div>
<div class="verse">A farm beside, where he did reside,</div>
<div class="verse">Claimed his skill and special pride.</div>
<div class="verse">He handled stock and rode his nag,</div>
<div class="verse">And had many things about which to brag.</div>
<div class="verse">In cows and swine his money he stuck</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
<div class="verse">To raise for profit and keep him up.</div>
<div class="verse">The clothes he wore hung on him loose,</div>
<div class="verse">Except when he did faultlessly spruce</div>
<div class="verse">Before his friends and neighbors to strut</div>
<div class="verse">In court, to pull his client out of a rut.</div>
<div class="verse">He had one pair of extra sized pants,</div>
<div class="verse">Made by a cousin or one of his aunts,</div>
<div class="verse">Known all around by every girl and boy,</div>
<div class="verse">In his vicinity, made of brown corduroy.</div>
<div class="verse">This pair loose he&#8217;d usually wear</div>
<div class="verse">With no chance for the brush to tear.</div>
<div class="verse">One sultry afternoon in the middle of June,</div>
<div class="verse">A couple of spinsters riding along soon</div>
<div class="verse">Discovered on one side of the road</div>
<div class="verse">This pair of pants where it was &#8220;throwed.&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">As they drew up close to the spot</div>
<div class="verse">Their nag whirled around in a trot;</div>
<div class="verse">The pants were moving and jumping about</div>
<div class="verse">These maids their wits scaring half out.</div>
<div class="verse">No James was by them seen at all,</div>
<div class="verse">But they knew the trousers of Saltenstall,</div>
<div class="verse">Who had hid in weeds with none on at all.</div>
<div class="verse">This mystery to them riding in the lane,</div>
<div class="verse">He never appeared and offered to explain.</div>
<div class="verse">Weeks passed by before they laid eye</div>
<div class="verse">Upon Saltenstall for whom they did spy,</div>
<div class="verse">This vision and its meaning to reveal.</div>
<div class="verse">They imagined they heard pigs squeal,</div>
<div class="verse">So by ifs and whats and twisting twigs,</div>
<div class="verse">They guessed the pants were full of pigs.</div>
<div class="verse">This story is true, and the riddle plain:</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
<div class="verse">James found in his pasture near the lane,</div>
<div class="verse">That his favorite sow the stork had blessed,</div>
<div class="verse">With a litter of pigs, so he was distressed,</div>
<div class="verse">To contrive a scheme to take pigs to barn,</div>
<div class="verse">And have them housed and shielded from harm.</div>
<div class="verse">No sack had he in which to fetch the pigs,</div>
<div class="verse">So these pants were used with his rigs.</div>
<div class="verse">When on his shoulders his pigs he did load,</div>
<div class="verse">In plain view he saw the maids in the road.</div>
<div class="verse">They were coming straight ahead in full view,</div>
<div class="verse">So off his shoulders the whole thing he threw,</div>
<div class="verse">And took to the weeds to get out of view.</div>
<div class="verse">These ladies came along, all as we have said,</div>
<div class="verse">And found matters as stated under this head.</div>

<div class="verse">And this list might be multiplied if we tried.</div>
<div class="verse">But of all those things we cannot make review.</div>
<div class="verse">For ages men did not know that the earth was round;</div>
<div class="verse">It was supposed to flat, and all the ground</div>
<div class="verse">Rested on the back of one man, whose picture is found</div>
<div class="verse">Still in old geographies, standing under his load,</div>
<div class="verse">With his feet upon the back of some large toad,</div>
<div class="verse">Or tortoise; and, that the sun was slipped clean</div>
<div class="verse">Back west to east, at night by us unseen,</div>
<div class="verse">In the chariot of the Sun-god with his team</div>
<div class="verse">Of steeds as swift as if they were run by steam.</div>
<div class="verse">These views by them held sacred were impressed</div>

<div class="verse">Deep enough into lines between lines,</div>
<div class="verse">Where sometimes most information one finds.</div>
<div class="verse">Shaking off their fear, daring men began to peer,</div>
<div class="verse">Into the upper air with telescopes, far and near;</div>
<div class="verse">Until upon them dawned beyond escape,</div>
<div class="verse">By the picture on the moon and its shape,</div>
<div class="verse">That, book or no book, the world was a globe.</div>
<div class="verse">And, to fully prove it, they toiled and strove,</div>
<div class="verse">Till Columbus the Great, did daringly navigate</div>
<div class="verse">Far enough to see it and stop the debate.</div>
<div class="verse">That one hazardous stroke by this brave man</div>

<div class="verse">The door now being thrown open wide, men pried,</div>

<div class="verse">By the light of astronomy as their guide,</div>
<div class="verse">It was discovered that those specks that shine</div>
<div class="verse">High up in the heavens at the night time</div>
<div class="verse">Are suns and worlds that in their orbits move</div>
<div class="verse">Around greater centers in distance so high</div>

<div class="verse">As time passed written on them page by page,</div>
<div class="verse">The history of the earth before the historic age;</div>
<div class="verse">Men have dug up fossils for scholar and sage.</div>
<div class="verse">With silken thread, they drew lightning from the sky,</div>

<div class="verse">Ourselves to control, by designing leaders led.</div>
<div class="verse">Those simple rules, by which nature acts,</div>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="antiqua">Courts and Laws</span></h2>
</div>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Next our courts and laws come in for review,</div>
<div class="verse">Not to gain applause, but my course to pursue.</div>
<div class="verse">Laws are rules as is taught in schools</div>
<div class="verse">To guide civil conduct into the right,</div>
<div class="verse">To redress wrongs and make us keep our plight.</div>
<div class="verse">Deeds of a certain kind are called crimes;</div>
<div class="verse">For the perpetration of which in historic times,</div>
<div class="verse">Men have sought to punish their course to stay,</div>
<div class="verse">Every one who does them in some kind of way.</div>
<div class="verse">By the power of the state men may collate,</div>
<div class="verse">All kinds of acts which by law they state</div>
<div class="verse">To be offenses for one them to perpetrate.</div>
<div class="verse">These acts in themselves, may be for our good</div>
<div class="verse">When understood, yet by the statute they would</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
<div class="verse">Be crimes just the same, whether bad or good.</div>
<div class="verse">The original idea of punishment probably grew out</div>
<div class="verse">Of our natural impulse just to take a bout</div>
<div class="verse">With any fellow who ever did us any dirt</div>
<div class="verse">To see if him we could not also hurt</div>
<div class="verse">A little more, or just as much as to us he did;</div>
<div class="verse">Pull his tooth for our tooth, and his eye with the lid,</div>
<div class="verse">For our eye he did black simply to pay him back.</div>
<div class="verse">In a later day to give reasons for our laws</div>
<div class="verse">Which by the wise were sought, we had to pause,</div>
<div class="verse">So then we simply said, punish to stop crime.</div>
<div class="verse">Now suppose that I could show that in no time,</div>
<div class="verse">Did punishment ever even our crimes diminish,</div>
<div class="verse">Much less did it ever bring them to a finish.</div>
<div class="verse">Your eyes will open wide when I say to you;</div>
<div class="verse">The stopping of crimes punishment will never do.</div>
<div class="verse">Men will more chances take, your neck to break,</div>
<div class="verse">Your goods to steal, and your girls to snake</div>
<div class="verse">Off and defile, even if you are wide awake</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
<div class="verse">Against the whole complicated machinery of the law,</div>
<div class="verse">Than they would by getting immediately into your claw;</div>
<div class="verse">When with weapons good, you certainly would</div>
<div class="verse">Make all respect your rights as you them understood.</div>
<div class="verse">The plan indicated above could not all at once</div>
<div class="verse">Be put into practice, for you&#8217;d be a dunce</div>
<div class="verse">To turn loose so many who had never had any</div>
<div class="verse">Training in the matter we set up as a crime.</div>
<div class="verse">The way for you to do is to drop one at a time</div>
<div class="verse">Of your statutory crimes punishable by fine,</div>
<div class="verse">Mostly passed to give jobs to a certain class</div>
<div class="verse">Of human vegetables who stalk about in brass.</div>
<div class="verse">That you may cautiously follow up the scale</div>
<div class="verse">In all its detail, and you&#8217;ll never fail</div>
<div class="verse">To accomplish good in giving people their rights</div>
<div class="verse">And in keeping them quiet and free from fights.</div>
<div class="verse">By the penitentiaries you keep and your jails</div>
<div class="verse">Where people sleep with vermin on rails;</div>
<div class="verse">Waiting for trial before jury and judge.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
<div class="verse">Weeks before they are allowed to budge,</div>
<div class="verse">Makes them have against you such a grudge;</div>
<div class="verse">That when they get loose, as they frequently do</div>
<div class="verse">They go at their old tricks with energy anew</div>
<div class="verse">To see how dastardly they can act in the crimes they do.</div>
<div class="verse">In your hatcheries of crime, the bunch you have to feed</div>
<div class="verse">Seems to be increasing with a gradual, steady speed.</div>
<div class="verse">The time may come when the gang in the walls,</div>
<div class="verse">May outnumber us when at their leader&#8217;s calls,</div>
<div class="verse">They might break out with a united band,</div>
<div class="verse">Overpower us, and devastate the land.</div>
<div class="verse">So that whatever you do, make your crimes few;</div>
<div class="verse">And those you do define, stand firmly to.</div>
<div class="verse">The more laws you have the more it&#8217;ll take</div>
<div class="verse">To handle all those who their behests break.</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Laws are a necessary evil&#8221; was truly said</div>
<div class="verse">By a great hero, now sleeping among the dead.</div>
<div class="verse">So the less of this evil upon ourselves we fix</div>
<div class="verse">The more good we can with our liberty mix.</div>
<div class="verse">Those progressives of you who make such ado</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
<div class="verse">About our laws, and the courts in which you sue,</div>
<div class="verse">Want to fill our statutes all the way through</div>
<div class="verse">With every law and sumptuary regulation,</div>
<div class="verse">On every subject in the whole creation,</div>
<div class="verse">That, in their wrought up imagination,</div>
<div class="verse">They can conceive of to make litigation;</div>
<div class="verse">(Telling us that they comprehend the situation)</div>
<div class="verse">They&#8217;d put on the books without investigation.</div>
<div class="verse">You&#8217;d like to snake all this through,</div>
<div class="verse">Thinking that nobody is watching you;</div>
<div class="verse">But you had better try and hold yourself back;</div>
<div class="verse">We are watching you, and I am now on your track.</div>
<div class="verse">Now the courts are made the laws to enforce;</div>
<div class="verse">It is their job, and you and I of course,</div>
<div class="verse">Cannot dictate to them what laws to enforce.</div>
<div class="verse">To criticise the courts as the newspapers do</div>
<div class="verse">Might put us in contempt, the same as you</div>
<div class="verse">In some cases where you had to keep out of view;</div>
<div class="verse">Or run a lively race to keep yourself out of jail</div>
<div class="verse">By hanging on to some big lawyer&#8217;s coat-tail.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
<div class="verse">About your courts I will simply suggest</div>
<div class="verse">That whatever might be done I deem it best</div>
<div class="verse">Of the things we might do, get judges true,</div>
<div class="verse">Learned and wise, and who do not know you</div>
<div class="verse">Nor me, nor any of the folks that sue</div>
<div class="verse">Their cases in court before them;</div>
<div class="verse">The opinions they write with type or pen</div>
<div class="verse">Will be free from the bias of men then.</div>
<div class="verse">They will consider the laws, sort out the flaws</div>
<div class="verse">In each case, and every litigated cause;</div>
<div class="verse">So that the judgment they shall render</div>
<div class="verse">Making you your supposed rights surrender</div>
<div class="verse">Will be honest, no matter what we tender;</div>
<div class="verse">Although you practically sink by their blunder</div>
<div class="verse">Until in amazement you begin to wonder</div>
<div class="verse">Whether your lawyer really did plunder</div>
<div class="verse">Through all the books to get you from under</div>
<div class="verse">The load that is imposed when your case is closed</div>
<div class="verse">In the court of the judge you supposed</div>
<div class="verse">Had sense enough not to be bulldozed.</div>

</div>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Two little frogs their legs began to turn,</div>
<div class="verse">Haply leaped and jumped into a churn.</div>
<div class="verse">The churn was filled about half full</div>
<div class="verse">Of milk from which we our butter pull.</div>
<div class="verse">One frog to his mate did say:&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;We&#8217;re here to stay and can&#8217;t get away.</div>
<div class="verse">Now you may paddle and your head addle,</div>
<div class="verse">But I&#8217;ll bebobdaddle if I&#8217;ll saddle</div>
<div class="verse">On myself the task to get out of the flask,</div>
<div class="verse">I&#8217;m going to die, and no use to cry,</div>
<div class="verse">So good-bye,&#8221; and down he went dead.</div>
<div class="verse">The other made no reply, but paddled ahead</div>
<div class="verse">And paid no heed to what the first had said.</div>
<div class="verse">By and by a big chunk of butter came</div>
<div class="verse">And, upon the same froggie rode</div>
<div class="verse">Feeling the load off his mind throw&#8217;d.</div>
<div class="verse">In a short time there came a grunting swine</div>
<div class="verse">Walking slowly up out of his grime,</div>
<div class="verse">And shaking off his slime, rooted the churn over,</div>
<div class="verse">Letting little froggie jump in clover.</div>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Nearly all of the animals go in herds,</div>
<div class="verse">Fishes, mammals, bees, ants, and even birds.</div>
<div class="verse">The snakes are not so socially inclined;</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
<div class="verse">They had rather with none combined,</div>
<div class="verse">Slip cautiously alone and snap from behind.</div>
<div class="verse">Man has always a social animal been,</div>
<div class="verse">To get his food and commit his sin.</div>
<div class="verse">He has always stood for organizations,</div>
<div class="verse">Municipalities, states and corporations,</div>
<div class="verse">Made to protect him against depredations.</div>
<div class="verse">Whenever new thoughts take form in his head,</div>
<div class="verse">He is sure to try to have others into them led,</div>
<div class="verse">By his talks and whatever by him is said.</div>
<div class="verse">Man has made laws and written them down,</div>
<div class="verse">Telling the good people all not frown;</div>
<div class="verse">That by their consent these laws are made:</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;The consent of the governed,&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">Is exactly what they said.</div>
<div class="verse">That is true as the law-makers by your vote,</div>
<div class="verse">Are elected your welfare to promote.</div>
<div class="verse">Laws are rules laid down for our control,</div>
<div class="verse">Pointing out paths where we may not stroll,</div>
<div class="verse">Marking the lines in which our rights are defined,</div>
<div class="verse">Commanding and forbidding the multifarious kind</div>
<div class="verse">Of the things we must do or leave behind.</div>
<div class="verse">Some laws are on natural justice based;</div>
<div class="verse">That might be speculatively traced</div>
<div class="verse">To the dealings of man in his beginning;</div>
<div class="verse">Starting out in the races he was winning</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
<div class="verse">Over his ancestors, those animals called &#8220;low,&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">He might have come upon one not so slow;</div>
<div class="verse">Who singly could not be brought down with a blow;</div>
<div class="verse">So with his likes he combined the swift one to get</div>
<div class="verse">For their food, and their appetites to whet.</div>
<div class="verse">Now when this animal combined they took,</div>
<div class="verse">The question was up, and not a law book,</div>
<div class="verse">By which to decide who should take the hide;</div>
<div class="verse">And into what and how many parts the rest to divide:</div>
<div class="verse">So they naturally counted the number of their gang,</div>
<div class="verse">While this juicy meat did before them hang;</div>
<div class="verse">And number parts equal to the number of them</div>
<div class="verse">Was equally cut off the beast from stern to stem:</div>
<div class="verse">The meat thus divided the hide could not</div>
<div class="verse">Be usefully carved up, so they gambled for it by lot:</div>
<div class="verse">In the hand of each a pebble to throw at a spot,</div>
<div class="verse">They took to try who closest to the mark got;</div>
<div class="verse">And the one it who did the nearest hit,</div>
<div class="verse">Took away the hide for his skill and grit.</div>
<div class="verse">The idea of justice thus received</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
<div class="verse">Is about as good as has ever been achieved,</div>
<div class="verse">By reading all the books in every case</div>
<div class="verse">Where the law is defined for the human race.</div>
<div class="verse">Life might be likened to a game of chance</div>
<div class="verse">And the laws, the rules by which we advance</div>
<div class="verse">Our men upon the board or throw the lance:</div>
<div class="verse">When people together their business transact,</div>
<div class="verse">Follow the rules, and courts will solve the contract.</div>
<div class="verse">When our forefathers made this Republic of ours,</div>
<div class="verse">They established a constitution limiting the powers,</div>
<div class="verse">That the government itself could exercise</div>
<div class="verse">The best to preserve our liberty they could devise.</div>
<div class="verse">Even before this fundamental law they did make,</div>
<div class="verse">Which of necessity did part of our liberty take,</div>
<div class="verse">They prefaced all our laws for me and you</div>
<div class="verse">With certain inalienable rights kept in view:</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;That all men were created equal,&#8221; they knew;</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;That life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">Were set out in plain view, our land to bless.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
<div class="verse">Now every law since that date passed by the state,</div>
<div class="verse">To that extent our liberties infringe, even though we scringe;</div>
<div class="verse">And feel the distress, without redress,</div>
<div class="verse">Of many iniquitous acts, even by Congress.</div>
<div class="verse">If men were actually well-behaved,</div>
<div class="verse">Much useless trouble and expense could be saved:</div>
<div class="verse">Laws being hobbies our liberties to restrain;</div>
<div class="verse">Some barely holding us, even with tight rein.</div>
<div class="verse">The socialist man, if I do not mistake,</div>
<div class="verse">Would all restraint from our law makers take,</div>
<div class="verse">So that the state might feed and regulate</div>
<div class="verse">All the peoples who come within its gate,</div>
<div class="verse">And all others&#8217; properties appropriate,</div>
<div class="verse">To the general good as by them understood.</div>
<div class="verse">The titles to your lands and everything good</div>
<div class="verse">That on them stands, they would concentrate</div>
<div class="verse">Into public hands whom they would nominate.</div>
<div class="verse">The labor and the work, the leaders would shirk,</div>
<div class="verse">Would be done by some one or his clerk.</div>
<div class="verse">So that we all would have a good time,</div>
<div class="verse">In our day, should we adopt their line.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Every man has a right to work and eat&#8221;;</div>
<div class="verse">And such clap trap of verbiage we meet,</div>
<div class="verse">On every hand as we go over our land.</div>
<div class="verse">They jabber, but their sense I can&#8217;t see.</div>
<div class="verse">How can this come in the land of the free?</div>
<div class="verse">They produce arguments hoary with age,</div>
<div class="verse">Used by many a high-class sage,</div>
<div class="verse">That the ownership of property&mdash;especially land,</div>
<div class="verse">Never had a foundation on which it could stand.</div>
<div class="verse">That the whole idea was a fiction once,</div>
<div class="verse">And not to see it now one is a dunce.</div>
<div class="verse">That all your vested rights on paper,</div>
<div class="verse">Are unsound, no matter what caper</div>
<div class="verse">Folks may cut their supposed rights to hold,</div>
<div class="verse">With all their power and hoarded gold.</div>
<div class="verse">If they can unite the working man on their side,</div>
<div class="verse">They hope into power to gloriously slide.</div>
<div class="verse">The men who labor with their hands have all</div>
<div class="verse">United into bands.</div>
<div class="verse">Feeling that the little work there is to do</div>
<div class="verse">Must pay the most to the ones who pursue</div>
<div class="verse">Trades of all kinds and of every hue.</div>
<div class="verse">That the work for men to do with hands</div>
<div class="verse">Is constant, regardless of supply and demands;</div>
<div class="verse">Never once observing that the cost</div>
<div class="verse">Of production many jobs them have lost.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
<div class="verse">So even if they do get more out of that they do;</div>
<div class="verse">The valuable time lost in the trades they pursue,</div>
<div class="verse">Will more than compensate for th&#8217; advanced rate</div>
<div class="verse">They obtain from the fewer jobs that remain.</div>
<div class="verse">Why it does not occur to them while they dream</div>
<div class="verse">What a big world this is with all its demesne,</div>
<div class="verse">Is a matter beyond explanation by what I ween.</div>
<div class="verse">That work is not confined on this big earth,</div>
<div class="verse">But spreads out to give us all a wide berth.</div>
<div class="verse">Against trusts and monied corporations,</div>
<div class="verse">Men in their stations might form associations</div>
<div class="verse">Their rights to demand and their wrongs to reduce,</div>
<div class="verse">But against th&#8217; individual there is no excuse,</div>
<div class="verse">Why unions upon him should heap their abuse.</div>
<div class="verse">If one build a house to cover up his head,</div>
<div class="verse">Why should union labor try to kill him dead,</div>
<div class="verse">By making the cost so high that none can buy,</div>
<div class="verse">Houses building now far and nigh.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
<div class="verse">But all these perplexing questions are upon us;</div>
<div class="verse">And the merits and demerits we must discuss,</div>
<div class="verse">If practical socialism must come,</div>
<div class="verse">We must face it, each and every one.</div>
<div class="verse">By the brotherhood of man, maybe we can</div>
<div class="verse">Find a way to harmonize every tribe and clan</div>
<div class="verse">And save this civilization for the good of man.</div>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">My subject here is simply a term to express</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;A somewhat,&#8221; the nature of which is a guess.</div>
<div class="verse">Of the substance contained in the above term,</div>
<div class="verse">It seems almost impossible for one to learn,</div>
<div class="verse">No image of it in his mind can he conceive,</div>
<div class="verse">Reflects the intelligence he&#8217;d wish to receive.</div>
<div class="verse">What the public looks like or is,</div>
<div class="verse">Is more than you can tell or wis.</div>
<div class="verse">According to some it&#8217;s &#8220;ideas in th&#8217; abstract.&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">So let us take that for the real fact.</div>
<div class="verse">The public does not seem to be you or I</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
<div class="verse">Or anybody else&mdash;I&#8217;ll tell you why;</div>
<div class="verse">Whoever or whatever the thing may be,</div>
<div class="verse">He, she, or it shoulders blame for you and me,</div>
<div class="verse">For wickedness done in his dear name,</div>
<div class="verse">And credit for intended good, the same,</div>
<div class="verse">In very many cases that men declaim.</div>
<div class="verse">If a bunch of grafters wish to float a deal,</div>
<div class="verse">Say in baking powder, wheat, or oat meal;</div>
<div class="verse">First the public pulse they scientifically feel,</div>
<div class="verse">To discover signs of fever germs in foods,</div>
<div class="verse">We&#8217;ve been eating, and such other goods</div>
<div class="verse">Of the same kinds we&#8217;ve bought all our lives,</div>
<div class="verse">And from which others are supporting wives,</div>
<div class="verse">And children as they&#8217;ve done all their lives.</div>
<div class="verse">Of course their doctor this pulse carefully felt,</div>
<div class="verse">And discovered that germ tracks were smelt</div>
<div class="verse">In most of the stuff we put in our pelt.</div>
<div class="verse">He discovered too that alum would</div>
<div class="verse">Dry up the diaphragm if used in food.</div>
<div class="verse">Also that certain foods contained sand,</div>
<div class="verse">That might get into the public craw, and</div>
<div class="verse">Brace them up too much to patriotically vote</div>
<div class="verse">For such a pure food law as they&#8217;d like to float.</div>
<div class="verse">So after their analysis was properly wrote,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
<div class="verse">They get their pure food law nicely framed up</div>
<div class="verse">To suit their scheme and for the people to gulp.</div>
<div class="verse">Then their bugle horns they did blare,</div>
<div class="verse">And it carried before we were aware.</div>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">In olden times, doctors and barbers were the same,</div>
<div class="verse">As we find in books from which we always gain</div>
<div class="verse">Information on all such historic matter.</div>
<div class="verse">As bleeding was the thing then to batter</div>
<div class="verse">Out diseases the striped pole must be</div>
<div class="verse">An emblematic relic of the blood running free</div>
<div class="verse">Down and around our hip, thigh and knee.</div>
<div class="verse">But the two trades have been now long separated;</div>
<div class="verse">And while neither should be underestimated</div>
<div class="verse">And both receive their due from me and you,</div>
<div class="verse">The barbers&#8217; trade is not really and truly due</div>
<div class="verse">As much criticism as is the medicine crew.</div>
<div class="verse">There are plenty of fine physicians and surgeons,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
<div class="verse">Who receive their praise from us in legions;</div>
<div class="verse">But the &#8220;money-rosis&#8221; has struck the doctors</div>
<div class="verse">As other trades, including divorce proctors.</div>
<div class="verse">I well remember in the days long past,</div>
<div class="verse">Pulse felt, and a look at the color the tongue cast,</div>
<div class="verse">When the doctor was done, and no more was asked.</div>
<div class="verse">He said it was simply chills and fever he did believe,</div>
<div class="verse">Which a good dose of calomel or blue mass would relieve,</div>
<div class="verse">All of which the patient did then and there receive.</div>
<div class="verse">You might have had a slight pain in your head,</div>
<div class="verse">And you were advised to lie still in bed.</div>
<div class="verse">Now call a doctor your wife to see,</div>
<div class="verse">And while you sent for only one to fee,</div>
<div class="verse">Two or three more and sometimes a score,</div>
<div class="verse">To handle the different parts of the sore,</div>
<div class="verse">Come in and watch around your door;</div>
<div class="verse">Especially if you&#8217;ve got money, and get more.</div>
<div class="verse">If you fall and bruise your knee or elbow</div>
<div class="verse">A specialist must come to whom they show</div>
<div class="verse">Some of the dirt from the place around,</div>
<div class="verse">To ascertain if any microbes are found.</div>
<div class="verse">If a cough or cold comes in your head,</div>
<div class="verse">A sample or two of the sputum that you shed,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
<div class="verse">Is sealed up and sent away to be analyzed.</div>
<div class="verse">They always find &#8217;em, so don&#8217;t be surprised.</div>
<div class="verse">And if plenty of money you can get</div>
<div class="verse">To pay all this cost and never sweat,</div>
<div class="verse">When your bills at home are all paid,</div>
<div class="verse">You&#8217;ll be then sent off on dress parade.</div>
<div class="verse">Doctors never come now and find you well;</div>
<div class="verse">Your ailments have names you cannot spell.</div>
<div class="verse">And when you ask what you&#8217;re about to take</div>
<div class="verse">The awful malady you have to try to shake</div>
<div class="verse">To pronounce its name your jawbone&#8217;ll break.</div>
<div class="verse">As simple a dose as soda and rain water</div>
<div class="verse">At the drug store will cost you a quarter.</div>
<div class="verse">All diseases now come straight from bacilli</div>
<div class="verse">Seen through those microscopes they buy.</div>
<div class="verse">Let these germs once your systems fill</div>
<div class="verse">You just as well not make your will,</div>
<div class="verse">It&#8217;ll take the farm to pay your doctor bill,</div>
<div class="verse">All diseases have now become contagious.</div>
<div class="verse">And their catching qualities outrageous.</div>
<div class="verse">When you walk do not spit on the street,</div>
<div class="verse">Lest your saliva infect those you meet.</div>
<div class="verse">No trains are allowed to have a drinking cup</div>
<div class="verse">In which others drink, lest you swallow up</div>
<div class="verse">The other fellow&#8217;s germs sticking to the glass</div>
<div class="verse">Of the family of microbes in the tubercular class.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
<div class="verse">No comb or brush is found to smooth your hair,</div>
<div class="verse">They&#8217;re prohibited and blacklisted everywhere.</div>
<div class="verse">All your water must be thoroughly boiled</div>
<div class="verse">And its palatable flavor entirely spoiled,</div>
<div class="verse">To slay the ferocious germs in it coiled.</div>
<div class="verse">And even the milk from your fat Jersey cow</div>
<div class="verse">Should be pasteurized as never before till now.</div>
<div class="verse">We might run down the whole category</div>
<div class="verse">Till you were tired, and I get hoary,</div>
<div class="verse">But these very things are the doctor&#8217;s glory.</div>
<div class="verse">Of course they are trying to lengthen life&#8217;s span,</div>
<div class="verse">And I&#8217;m not going to censure them if I can,</div>
<div class="verse">Only caution them to be easy as they can.</div>
<div class="verse">They don&#8217;t catch me often, my father was a physician,</div>
<div class="verse">And before he died, he made it his mission</div>
<div class="verse">To post me and make me wise on this score.</div>
<div class="verse">I have sometimes felt peevish and sore</div>
<div class="verse">Because father was too honest to lay up a store</div>
<div class="verse">For me to spend when I life began;</div>
<div class="verse">My father was above all an honest man.</div>
<div class="verse">Once my wife took pneumonic cough</div>
<div class="verse">And we for a doctor sent right off.</div>
<div class="verse">He came and found genuine bacilli.</div>
<div class="verse">Scared me, and made the wife almost cry.</div>
<div class="verse">They analyzed, criticised and diagnosed</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
<div class="verse">And sent her away, with my house closed;</div>
<div class="verse">And for nights I scarcely dozed.</div>
<div class="verse">They gave her just six months of life</div>
<div class="verse">Before consumption would part me and my wife.</div>
<div class="verse">My plucky woman partly believed what they said,</div>
<div class="verse">And moped around a while and stayed in bed.</div>
<div class="verse">I had some doubts about what the specialists said,</div>
<div class="verse">And relied a little on what an old friend read,</div>
<div class="verse">Who had much practical experience, she said.</div>
<div class="verse">Of course my doubts about science I hate to tell,</div>
<div class="verse">But in a few weeks the wife was entirely well.</div>
<div class="verse">If the doctor wants to, let him tell</div>
<div class="verse">Why into the aforesaid mistake he fell.</div>
<div class="verse">Now you had all better beware and treat us fair,</div>
<div class="verse">If you have doubts about what our troubles are</div>
<div class="verse">Just do your best, and let nature do the rest.</div>

<div class="verse">When the lawyer&#8217;s job in the country gets short,</div>

<div class="verse">Not afraid to give advice, I&#8217;m one of you,</div>
<div class="verse">You may heed, or I don&#8217;t care what you do.</div>
<div class="verse">You give advice and charge for the same;</div>
<div class="verse">Mine I freely give, and you get the gain.</div>
<div class="verse">When you get free what to others you sell,</div>
<div class="verse">You&#8217;ve something to brag about and tell.</div>
<div class="verse">I like you, you bunch of jolly good fellows,</div>
<div class="verse">Though you sometimes lunch like Col. Sellers.</div>
<div class="verse">And your Sunday suit gets so slick,</div>
<div class="verse">That a fly cannot walk on it and stick.</div>
<div class="verse">You too are letting people into your trade.</div>
<div class="verse">Deeds and legal papers are so easily made,</div>

<div class="verse">Those you write are paid for in thanks.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>

<div class="verse">Or waiting for a client to bring around a fee.</div>
<div class="verse">Sometimes you read or skip around in glee,</div>
<div class="verse">To make the impression that your mind is free;</div>
<div class="verse">And that you have plenty of work to do;</div>
<div class="verse">And never for a moment take a solemn view</div>
<div class="verse">Of how fast business is flying away from you.</div>
<div class="verse">Some of you are learning on a motor cycle to ride,</div>
<div class="verse">So when an accident occurs you are by the side</div>
<div class="verse">Of the injured one to get a damage suit</div>
<div class="verse">Against the company whose coffers you&#8217;d loot.</div>
<div class="verse">Some of you join the gang and get in politics,</div>
<div class="verse">To get some legal job they may help you fix.</div>
<div class="verse">One of you stirs up strife against divorce,</div>
<div class="verse">And gets to be proctor on the welfare force,</div>
<div class="verse">And gets a small salary as a matter of course.</div>
<div class="verse">Some get to be orators public affairs to discuss.</div>
<div class="verse">And get the press over you to make a fuss;</div>
<div class="verse">In that way you advertise your brains good</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>

<div class="verse">Some join with unions to fight against the trusts,</div>
<div class="verse">Others against the unions sling their deadly thrusts.</div>
<div class="verse">Thus in battle array, some right and some wrong,</div>
<div class="verse">We manage in some way to push ourselves along.</div>
<div class="verse">The race of the old-time lawyers is nearly extinct</div>
<div class="verse">To whose memory my fond thoughts are linked.</div>
<div class="verse">I know a few whose names I&#8217;ll not give to you</div>
<div class="verse">Owing to my plan I intend to follow through,</div>
<div class="verse">Not to give names unless to represent a crew.</div>
<div class="verse">You know some yourself not in the law for pelf;</div>
<div class="verse">I&#8217;m one myself if into my record you care to look,</div>
<div class="verse">If I hadn&#8217;t been I need not have written a book</div>
<div class="verse">To make a little stake to put away for a rainy day.</div>

<div class="verse">Except when they serve you to get their pay.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
<div class="verse">They have to be deceiving to keep up with you:</div>
<div class="verse">You will not take your case you wish to sue</div>
<div class="verse">To some attorney who could not stand for you.</div>
<div class="verse">You know the attorney stands in your place,</div>
<div class="verse">And to an honest one you dare not show your face.</div>
<div class="verse">I&#8217;ve known lawyers who courted the name of crook,</div>
<div class="verse">Merely to catch grafters on their own hook.</div>
<div class="verse">You know well when you are sued that you choose</div>
<div class="verse">An attorney who will by any ruse, you excuse</div>
<div class="verse">To the jury who tried your case for the deeds,</div>
<div class="verse">You did, and you know you did not get your meeds.</div>
<div class="verse">So shut up your mouth and hie yourself home;</div>
<div class="verse">The subject of judges and lawyers leave alone.</div>
<div class="verse">Lawyers have always been pillars of the state</div>
<div class="verse">To uphold our institutions you&#8217;d annihilate.</div>
<div class="verse">Their trade is not alone on paper made;</div>
<div class="verse">It comes from growth by development&#8217;s aid.</div>
<div class="verse">It&#8217;s the garnered experience of all the ages,</div>
<div class="verse">Written in books upon numberless pages.</div>
<div class="verse">It has stood when empires fell,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
<div class="verse">When to the despots they did loudly tell</div>
<div class="verse">Of justice upon him the law&#8217;d compel;</div>
<div class="verse">It has stood against strife, slaughter and blood,</div>
<div class="verse">When other trades and institutions never could;</div>
<div class="verse">It rises in the right, iniquity to fight,</div>
<div class="verse">To protect the weak against men of might,</div>
<div class="verse">Over widows and orphans its protecting arm</div>
<div class="verse">Is extended to save the mortgaged farm;</div>
<div class="verse">It shields the criminal against the crazy mob</div>
<div class="verse">Giving him a trial of which they&#8217;d him rob.</div>
<div class="verse">For peace and order and justice in the land</div>
<div class="verse">Let us ever as true lawyers stand.</div>

<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="antiqua">Names</span></h2>
</div>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">By the use of names we designate</div>
<div class="verse">Some particular thing, person or state.</div>
<div class="verse">The naming of animals in the first place,</div>
<div class="verse">Was put upon Adam as father of the race.</div>
<div class="verse">This job imposed upon him no great task,</div>
<div class="verse">Because no one&#8217;s permission he had to ask,</div>
<div class="verse">Whether the name suited mule or cow,</div>
<div class="verse">Or the name horse he might to kid allow.</div>
<div class="verse">Now the names of animals who came</div>
<div class="verse">Before him in a long-extended train,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
<div class="verse">They had to take those which for them he did book</div>
<div class="verse">Because they did not have a list over which to look.</div>
<div class="verse">All proper names men can find,</div>
<div class="verse">Have been so often used by men of their kind,</div>
<div class="verse">That when a child is about to be born,</div>
<div class="verse">Into the world, the name it shall adorn</div>
<div class="verse">Has to be taken from the long list</div>
<div class="verse">Of those gone before, or who still persist.</div>
<div class="verse">Although we have quite a long catalogue,</div>
<div class="verse">We still have to search and our memory jog</div>
<div class="verse">To ascertain the character of the ones</div>
<div class="verse">Who bore the name about to be given to our sons;</div>
<div class="verse">Because any name may have been soiled</div>
<div class="verse">By its owner around whom might be coiled</div>
<div class="verse">The evidence of some offense the name to suffuse</div>
<div class="verse">Before the time we it did choose.</div>
<div class="verse">The likes and dislikes for names we take,</div>
<div class="verse">Come mostly from the character of the namesake.</div>
<div class="verse">A lot of names might be brought to view:</div>
<div class="verse">Like Jennie, Sallie, Mollie, Kate and Sue;</div>
<div class="verse">Or Perkins, Phelps, Pickering, and Penn,</div>
<div class="verse">And a whole book full of names for women and men.</div>
<div class="verse">The others need not here be enrolled,</div>
<div class="verse">In this little volume, or by me polled.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
<div class="verse">The things that did once make names great</div>
<div class="verse">Generally were acts done for the state,</div>
<div class="verse">Mostly in war, e. g., Alexander the Great,</div>
<div class="verse">Or Caesar, or even Napoleon the Sedate.</div>
<div class="verse">Sometimes names receive much eclat</div>
<div class="verse">At home, as well as near and far,</div>
<div class="verse">Like Washington, or our Jefferson,</div>
<div class="verse">And also Cleveland and Lincoln,</div>
<div class="verse">By statesmanship with head and brain</div>
<div class="verse">For the public good when peace did reign.</div>
<div class="verse">There used to be a time, now almost past,</div>
<div class="verse">When patriotism was then in full blast,</div>
<div class="verse">That men would sometimes almost actually do things</div>
<div class="verse">With no other pay than the consolation it brings,</div>
<div class="verse">Simply to be esteemed just, good and true,</div>
<div class="verse">With no other motive than to bless me and you.</div>
<div class="verse">But now of late men look upon the state</div>
<div class="verse">Simply as a fat goose for them down,</div>
<div class="verse">As o&#8217;er them her wings may spread around,</div>
<div class="verse">To hover and her blessings bring down.</div>
<div class="verse">The offices men fill to uphold the law,</div>
<div class="verse">Or collect our revenues to fat their maw</div>
<div class="verse">Are held mostly by ones we did not choose,</div>
<div class="verse">Who with politicians by some sharp ruse</div>
<div class="verse">Got nominated and elected against our views;</div>
<div class="verse">And when elected frame up bills</div>
<div class="verse">For legislation that their own pocket fills,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
<div class="verse">Regardless of the trouble and all the ills,</div>
<div class="verse">That fall upon the public that foots the bills.</div>
<div class="verse">New bureaus are made about everything</div>
<div class="verse">To which a gang of leaches can cling;</div>
<div class="verse">With their matrons, clerks and superintendents,</div>
<div class="verse">All hangers-on and their bunch of dependents,</div>
<div class="verse">Disgracing all over our broad land,</div>
<div class="verse">On every hand, the very name of man:</div>
<div class="verse">I fear that our present civilization cannot stand,</div>
<div class="verse">To live down the iniquity by them thus began.</div>
<div class="verse">The euphonious name of Guggenheimer,</div>
<div class="verse">Sipniski, Schradski, or even Joe Reimer,</div>
<div class="verse">Now is fine if their amounts in bank,</div>
<div class="verse">Stood their drafts and never shrank</div>
<div class="verse">Below the balance they had on hand</div>
<div class="verse">With the banks throughout the land.</div>
<div class="verse">A good name is appraised above riches,</div>
<div class="verse">But to keep that good to which one hitches,</div>
<div class="verse">When anyone can claim any name he likes</div>
<div class="verse">And ruin it forever, when off he hikes</div>
<div class="verse">To Canada or Old Mexico to get away</div>
<div class="verse">From the crimes he did in his day;</div>
<div class="verse">Making the name disgraceful he wears,</div>
<div class="verse">And none of the same name spares</div>
<div class="verse">From sharing the shame brought on the name,</div>
<div class="verse">To us, innocent and free from blame,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
<div class="verse">Except for the acts he did against our name.</div>
<div class="verse">Ambition leads us to attempt undying fame,</div>
<div class="verse">That after we are dead and in our grave</div>
<div class="verse">Our name shall live that we did engrave</div>
<div class="verse">Among the world&#8217;s heroes on every page</div>
<div class="verse">Of history that dies not with old age.</div>
<div class="verse">But everything to make us famous or great</div>
<div class="verse">Has been by someone, somewhere in every state</div>
<div class="verse">Of civilization accomplished and achieved,</div>
<div class="verse">So no chance is left for us, though grieved.</div>
<div class="verse">So let us not try to make our names great;</div>
<div class="verse">But instead, unite to rescue our own state,</div>
<div class="verse">From the clutches of the vultures at its heart;</div>
<div class="verse">And if we succeed at that, when we depart,</div>
<div class="verse">Those left behind will bear us in mind,</div>
<div class="verse">And write our names in the highest place they find.</div>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">In all the past the records are full of war;</div>
<div class="verse">Men had one desire to be in a continual jar;</div>
<div class="verse">Or else the peaceful victories they did win</div>
<div class="verse">Were not such as they wrote therein.</div>
<div class="verse">Each nation, tribe, and men of ancient race</div>
<div class="verse">For each other had nothing but hatred and menace.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
<div class="verse">Upon the boundaries and rights of each,</div>
<div class="verse">The other did recklessly go to reach,</div>
<div class="verse">With rapine and murder in their hearts,</div>
<div class="verse">To snatch from each other all such parts</div>
<div class="verse">Of their lands, and their goods to confiscate,</div>
<div class="verse">As could be done by the hordes they did aggregate.</div>
<div class="verse">Their warriors and men to subjugate,</div>
<div class="verse">Their women and fair maids to subject</div>
<div class="verse">To brutality, and any other object</div>
<div class="verse">As they chose upon them to impose.</div>
<div class="verse">There were only two kinds in those times</div>
<div class="verse">Of peoples on earth, those in their own confines,</div>
<div class="verse">And barbarians who dwelt anywhere else,</div>
<div class="verse">Regardless of who they were, Goths, Huns or Celts.</div>
<div class="verse">No tie of sympathy was known or recognized,</div>
<div class="verse">Between those different tribes;</div>
<div class="verse">Each for the other was lawful prize.</div>
<div class="verse">Robbery, theft, and murder were terms,</div>
<div class="verse">Applied to deeds committed at home;</div>
<div class="verse">These same acts out where they did roam,</div>
<div class="verse">Were designated bravery and prowess,</div>
<div class="verse">When upon barbarians they did egress,</div>
<div class="verse">With battle-axe, darts, helmet and shield,</div>
<div class="verse">Bent on the slaughter of their fellow man;</div>
<div class="verse">For conquest and glory, they led the van;</div>
<div class="verse">Over mountains filled with perpetual snow,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
<div class="verse">Into heated valleys where the sun did glow;</div>
<div class="verse">They fought for pride, religion and show;</div>
<div class="verse">As upon crowned heads they wore</div>
<div class="verse">Laurels of victory for blood and gore.</div>
<div class="verse">But now has dawned a better day;</div>
<div class="verse">From ocean to ocean where men survey</div>
<div class="verse">Their lands and the boundaries fix</div>
<div class="verse">Where rights of each the line restricts;</div>
<div class="verse">And treaties with one nation is made</div>
<div class="verse">With others to settle their commerce and trade.</div>
<div class="verse">They bring across oceans in merchant marine,</div>
<div class="verse">Luxuries of life now by us all seen,</div>
<div class="verse">Grown and shipped from the uttermost lands,</div>
<div class="verse">Divided from us by seas, deserts and sands.</div>
<div class="verse">Those natural laws we are learning to use,</div>
<div class="verse">Based upon justice according to the views</div>
<div class="verse">Of publicists and statesmen applied</div>
<div class="verse">To nations dealing with nations the world wide.</div>
<div class="verse">Now the crude implements of death once used</div>
<div class="verse">By ancients, are thrown aside and refused.</div>
<div class="verse">In place of triremes propelled by oars,</div>
<div class="verse">Steel-clad battleships ride by scores,</div>
<div class="verse">Manned with guns throwing missiles miles;</div>
<div class="verse">Around our coasts and adjacent isles;</div>
<div class="verse">Our barricades and our battlements,</div>
<div class="verse">Our field glasses and our armaments;</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
<div class="verse">Our powder in guns and in mines,</div>
<div class="verse">With deadly explosives of all kinds,</div>
<div class="verse">Making killing a thing of skill</div>
<div class="verse">Upon the thousands our inventions kill,</div>
<div class="verse">All are bringing war to a standstill.</div>
<div class="verse">No longer do we hand to hand in war engage;</div>
<div class="verse">Foes rushing foes with eyes in a rage;</div>
<div class="verse">Instead, the scientific gunner his aim to gauge,</div>
<div class="verse">Miles away, his gun adjusting to suit,</div>
<div class="verse">Deals death to thousands, wherever he may shoot;</div>
<div class="verse">With no malice in his heart, by electric touch,</div>
<div class="verse">Some mine is exploded, killing and destroying as much</div>
<div class="verse">In a single blow, as was done in a day the old way;</div>
<div class="verse">And in all the soldiers are out of the fray.</div>
<div class="verse">Why should we slaughter and fellow men slay,</div>
<div class="verse">In this unimpassioned, calculating, scientific way?</div>
<div class="verse">If such things, done by the whole nation,</div>
<div class="verse">Were done by one, it&#8217;d be murder in our estimation.</div>
<div class="verse">Inventions and knowledge lead towards peace;</div>
<div class="verse">And the frequency of war decrease;</div>
<div class="verse">The more we know of our fellowman.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
<div class="verse">The less we like to cut off his span.</div>

<div class="verse">Till from war and all its sickening pall,</div>
<div class="verse">We advance, and universal peace install;</div>
<div class="verse">And we may, unless we get up a protocol,</div>

<div class="verse">About the subject of music what can I say?</div>

<div class="verse">The origin of which none seem to know;</div>

<div class="verse">In their lonely isle of forests and glades,</div>
<div class="verse">Their magic spells, in song, upon the sailor wrought,</div>
<div class="verse">With all his crew, to their abode they brought,</div>

<div class="verse">Undid the deed done his men confined in a pen;</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
<div class="verse">Or when Orpheus with his lyre in his hand,</div>

<div class="verse">But in all times before this day of ours,</div>
<div class="verse">When men have harnessed th&#8217; unseen powers:</div>
<div class="verse">It did take the skill of finger tips</div>
<div class="verse">Or the trill of throat and puckered lips,</div>
<div class="verse">To wake from vibrations thereby made,</div>
<div class="verse">The thrilling chant and sweet serenade.</div>
<div class="verse">But now with pricking pins of steel,</div>
<div class="verse">Those same vibrations come from turn of wheel,</div>
<div class="verse">When in dents lightly made on a disc,</div>
<div class="verse">Which around and around we playfully whisk;</div>
<div class="verse">The pin points strike in and then out,</div>

<div class="verse">The picture of the whole sound action it takes;</div>
<div class="verse">And reproduces the vibrations on our ear,</div>
<div class="verse">Of an opera or any piece we wish to hear.</div>
<div class="verse">By the numerous machines by inventors made,</div>
<div class="verse">The sweet music once by human skill played,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
<div class="verse">Has passed into commerce of daily trade.</div>

<div class="verse">True music that really stirs the hearts of men</div>

<div class="verse">As it comes to our ears in tones profound,</div>

<div class="verse">Calling us to war and its deadly strife;</div>
<div class="verse">Or those mysterious strains of the violin,</div>

<div class="verse">By the screeching buzzes they make;</div>

<div class="verse">Which ragtime has sought to besmirch.</div>
<div class="verse">But of all of this let us not complain,</div>

<div class="verse">Thus onward our wheels of progress are rolling,</div>
<div class="verse">Crushing out the heart of Genius strolling</div>
<div class="verse">Over lands vying, with his puny hands,</div>
<div class="verse">With forces of nature invention commands.</div>
<div class="verse">We should pause sometimes in our rapid flight,</div>
<div class="verse">Long enough to reflect on the dangers that might</div>
<div class="verse">Wreck our civilization; children would their lives destroy</div>
<div class="verse">Were they allowed to handle guns as a toy;</div>
<div class="verse">So with man in his audacious daring</div>
<div class="verse">Handling these forces recklessly, caring</div>
<div class="verse">Little for those who are smashed beneath their grinding,</div>
<div class="verse">As the end to the glories of art they are finding.</div>

<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="antiqua">My Fiddle</span></h2>
</div>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">When my years numbered less than ten,</div>
<div class="verse">I stayed with an uncle and aunt now and then,</div>
<div class="verse">Who lived a few miles from our own door.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
<div class="verse">Now when I think of those days of yore,</div>
<div class="verse">When I lingered around the cabin door,</div>
<div class="verse">In rapture listening to the violin,</div>
<div class="verse">Held under our old black man&#8217;s chin;</div>
<div class="verse">And its melody did my young heart win,</div>
<div class="verse">Recollection goes back to my violin.</div>
<div class="verse">This old fiddle came to me in a trade,</div>
<div class="verse">That I with our work-hand made;</div>
<div class="verse">And I learned to play for the serenade.</div>
<div class="verse">I rosined my bow and handled it too,</div>
<div class="verse">And loved this fiddle the whole day through.</div>
<div class="verse">I played it nights before I went to sleep;</div>
<div class="verse">Rolled it in flannel its tone to keep;</div>
<div class="verse">Put it in the box which I did make;</div>
<div class="verse">And took it out mornings soon as I&#8217;d wake.</div>
<div class="verse">My aunt, who lived at the house where I went,</div>
<div class="verse">With whom I stayed and many hours spent</div>
<div class="verse">Was of the old school in the ideas she had;</div>
<div class="verse">The most things I thought good she deemed bad.</div>
<div class="verse">A deck of cards would have made her collapse;</div>
<div class="verse">And for amusements now offered chaps,</div>
<div class="verse">They&#8217;d been abomination in her very sight;</div>
<div class="verse">The fiddle she thought her soul would blight.</div>
<div class="verse">And even the box it was carried in,</div>
<div class="verse">Was contaminated with the ghost of the violin.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
<div class="verse">This vile thing was played for the dance,</div>
<div class="verse">And that made it the horror of my aunt&#8217;s.</div>
<div class="verse">Of all this I was then in ignorant bliss.</div>
<div class="verse">So feeling good, I did not want to miss</div>
<div class="verse">The chance to show my aunt how I did play</div>
<div class="verse">On my fine instrument with much display.</div>
<div class="verse">So carefully boxing it up, I took it to stay</div>
<div class="verse">At the home of my aunt, to whom I&#8217;d show</div>
<div class="verse">My performance with the fiddle and bow.</div>
<div class="verse">When I arrived she greeted me before she did see,</div>
<div class="verse">What was under the seat in the buggy with me.</div>
<div class="verse">When I pulled it out I plainly saw</div>
<div class="verse">A cloud come over her as she stood in awe.</div>
<div class="verse">She did not at that time speak her full mind</div>
<div class="verse">But in memory lingering now I find</div>
<div class="verse">She said to herself something or other</div>
<div class="verse">To the effect that my father and mother,</div>
<div class="verse">Who were her sister, and in law her brother,</div>
<div class="verse">Didn&#8217;t have the same care for their child,</div>
<div class="verse">As she did for hers, or else how could they defile</div>
<div class="verse">A little boy like me with such a tool of evil</div>
<div class="verse">Specially devoted to sin and the service of the devil.</div>
<div class="verse">I took my poor fiddle and lugged it to my room,</div>
<div class="verse">Where I did not string it up so very soon.</div>
<div class="verse">But on one rainy day I took it out to play</div>
<div class="verse">Strains of old hymns that in my memory lay.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
<div class="verse">The thunder&#8217;s crash and the lightning&#8217;s play</div>
<div class="verse">Could not from my aunt keep away</div>
<div class="verse">The penetrating sound my violin bore,</div>
<div class="verse">Only a moment and she was at my door.</div>
<div class="verse">I saw in horror my aunt stand before,</div>
<div class="verse">With uplifted hands as her eyes bore,</div>
<div class="verse">Riveting me in silence to the floor.</div>
<div class="verse">The anger, pity, grief, fear and pain</div>
<div class="verse">In her face made upon me its lasting stain.</div>
<div class="verse">In words not spoken as much as shrieked,</div>
<div class="verse">She revealed why her face was streaked</div>
<div class="verse">With the lines I saw when she appeared:</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Put that horrid thing away,&#8221; she whispered;</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Put it in the back closet and lock the door.&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">She insisted: &#8220;Hide it quick, I implore;</div>
<div class="verse">The Lord in his wrath will blow the house o&#8217;er!</div>
<div class="verse">Don&#8217;t you know better than to tempt God in that way,</div>
<div class="verse">While the lightning and thunder His power display?&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">I admit that I did not know, but in my heart,</div>
<div class="verse">Then tender in years, was lodged a dart</div>
<div class="verse">It took years to remove; even now when I start</div>
<div class="verse">Upon my new violin some music to play</div>
<div class="verse">I wonder sometimes if in some mysterious way</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
<div class="verse">There is not lurking in it some demon still,</div>
<div class="verse">Its tones and notes sound so awfully shrill.</div>
<div class="verse">I would not for a single moment profane</div>
<div class="verse">The memory of my dear aunt I still retain,</div>
<div class="verse">Nor at her sincere beliefs cast one single slur.</div>
<div class="verse">I write here what did actually occur.</div>
<div class="verse">A coolness between me and the fiddle I love</div>
<div class="verse">Sprang up from the incident related above,</div>
<div class="verse">That lasted all the days of my youth</div>
<div class="verse">When I might have learned the violin in truth;</div>
<div class="verse">That instrument none can ever master,</div>
<div class="verse">Who does not cling to it in every disaster.</div>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="antiqua">Scientific Ethics</span></h2>
</div>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Having now had with you our several quarrels</div>
<div class="verse">We advance our lance to the subject of morals.</div>
<div class="verse">Ethics is a theme from which I can glean</div>
<div class="verse">Some substantial hopes for a better day;</div>
<div class="verse">When, with our prejudices all put away,</div>
<div class="verse">We shall all learn to act and think the things,</div>
<div class="verse">Which keep in view the good life to us brings.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
<div class="verse">While this subject is as plain as a b c</div>
<div class="verse">The same for some reason you fail to see.</div>
<div class="verse">Morals are the manners and customs one adopts</div>
<div class="verse">For himself in private life, while he hops,</div>
<div class="verse">Or walks and talks with his fellow men.</div>
<div class="verse">Good morals are good habits and bad, bad.</div>
<div class="verse">Habits are easily made, and when once had,</div>
<div class="verse">They are hard to break for anybody&#8217;s sake.</div>
<div class="verse">The &#8220;stream of thought&#8221; seems the road to take,</div>
<div class="verse">Where it once had run anywhere under the sun.</div>
<div class="verse">Morals are the acts of which life is composed</div>
<div class="verse">That we have upon ourselves imposed.</div>
<div class="verse">This definition was made by Immanuel Kant,</div>
<div class="verse">But as it is self evident, he needn&#8217;t want,</div>
<div class="verse">All the credit to claim if I use the same.</div>
<div class="verse">Laws cause you do as others compel you;</div>
<div class="verse">Ethics cause you to do what you like to.</div>
<div class="verse">There are only two things that push us along.</div>
<div class="verse">Think about it till you rack your brains,</div>
<div class="verse">And you&#8217;ll find them always pleasures and pains.</div>
<div class="verse">Some even take pleasure in their sorrow and grief;</div>
<div class="verse">And you&#8217;d not be thanked for offering a relief;</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
<div class="verse">Nor for producing a balm to heal their wounds,</div>
<div class="verse">From which they suffered, regardless of their grounds.</div>
<div class="verse">Men, of their humility have been so proud;</div>
<div class="verse">That lugubriously, they&#8217;d stand up in any crowd;</div>
<div class="verse">Or with their heads bowed and on bended knees,</div>
<div class="verse">With the pride of their humbleness you they&#8217;d freeze.</div>
<div class="verse">The pleasures we desire and the pains we shun,</div>
<div class="verse">Were our only motives since the world begun.</div>
<div class="verse">Now keep this in mind as its use you&#8217;ll find,</div>
<div class="verse">As we treat of ethics and its motives behind.</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Self-imposed precepts&#8221; are not the moral code,</div>
<div class="verse">Prevalent in places where men their guns load,</div>
<div class="verse">To meet a fellow man in the public road,</div>
<div class="verse">To try out the question with bullets of lead,</div>
<div class="verse">On the field of honor, till one or both are dead;</div>
<div class="verse">Nor is it the legal code enacted by man,</div>
<div class="verse">Making rules against things under ban.</div>
<div class="verse">Morals deal with acts men actually intend,</div>
<div class="verse">Those motions adapted to some end.</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;The wild gesticulations of a lunatic,&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">Or of a crazy man who automatically throws a brick,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
<div class="verse">Bear no relation to the discussion of ethics.</div>
<div class="verse">The standards of morals take their hue</div>
<div class="verse">From the aims of life men hold in view.</div>
<div class="verse">The pessimist says life&#8217;s a failure entire,</div>
<div class="verse">So to meet the demands his views require,</div>
<div class="verse">A scheme of acts adapted to shortening life</div>
<div class="verse">To get this set soonest out of the strife,</div>
<div class="verse">And all the sad and tragic things,</div>
<div class="verse">The whole of existence to them brings,</div>
<div class="verse">Would be the highest standard of acts,</div>
<div class="verse">Which in goodness one for them enacts.</div>
<div class="verse">The optimist takes a very different view,</div>
<div class="verse">Life&#8217;s a pleasure while he its joys pursue.</div>
<div class="verse">For him a general life suited to make,</div>
<div class="verse">Life long, broad and deep for his sake,</div>
<div class="verse">Would be a good banner at him to shake.</div>
<div class="verse">So we say, bad morals are bad, and good, good.</div>
<div class="verse">The reason the subject by you is not understood,</div>
<div class="verse">Is, that while you must surely know,</div>
<div class="verse">You constantly misapply to ethics one word as you go.</div>
<div class="verse">The meaning of this word if you don&#8217;t get,</div>
<div class="verse">Is from stupidity, for you never yet</div>
<div class="verse">Went into a store anything to buy or even try,</div>
<div class="verse">But a practical demonstration was before your eye.</div>
<div class="verse">The first thing you ask about a razor or knife,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
<div class="verse">Is this, &#8220;Is it good?&#8221; and the clerk doesn&#8217;t cry,</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;What do you mean!&#8221; if he wants you to buy.</div>
<div class="verse">He politely answers, &#8220;Both these tools cut good,</div>
<div class="verse">As they are warranted, one whiskers, and one wood,</div>
<div class="verse">And both of them do their part very good.&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">If one of you farmers wished to acquire a cow,</div>
<div class="verse">You wouldn&#8217;t ask whether she could make a bow;</div>
<div class="verse">You would enquire how much milk she gave,</div>
<div class="verse">And how much butter, and could she save</div>
<div class="verse">You some expense in the way she&#8217;d behave.</div>
<div class="verse">If such questions had all been left out,</div>
<div class="verse">And the seller had known what he was about,</div>
<div class="verse">He&#8217;d said, &#8220;She&#8217;s good,&#8221; and everything&#8217;s understood.</div>
<div class="verse">If a female reader went to buy a new spring hat,</div>
<div class="verse">And the thing was in style, you would close your chat.</div>
<div class="verse">If it was in style, it&#8217;s good, every fool knows that,</div>
<div class="verse">The bargain&#8217;s made and the hat charged to pap.</div>
<div class="verse">The same thing is true of skirts and hoops,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
<div class="verse">Of dogs and cats, and chickens in coops;</div>
<div class="verse">You can&#8217;t look about or run around,</div>
<div class="verse">Without understanding this word always so profound,</div>
<div class="verse">And mysterious when applied to my theme;</div>
<div class="verse">With yawning face you almost dream,</div>
<div class="verse">And look confused when I try to tell what I mean.</div>
<div class="verse">You never ask about any of the things I&#8217;ve spoke,</div>
<div class="verse">Whether they say their prayers and never joke,</div>
<div class="verse">To speak of such, you at me your fun poke.</div>
<div class="verse">Now we&#8217;ll see whether you are sensible folk,</div>
<div class="verse">When you try to shed your customary cloak</div>
<div class="verse">Of prejudice and mysticism you croak,</div>
<div class="verse">Every time you try sense to ethics to apply.</div>
<div class="verse">Common sense teaches us there is no reason why,</div>
<div class="verse">The definition will not fit conduct every whit,</div>
<div class="verse">As it did other things about which I&#8217;ve writ.</div>
<div class="verse">Conduct is good if its ends come through,</div>
<div class="verse">And its natural results are good for me and you.</div>
<div class="verse">I take the optimist&#8217;s view, life&#8217;s a blessing,</div>
<div class="verse">And when to you my words I&#8217;m addressing,</div>
<div class="verse">Say whether I&#8217;m right in possessing,</div>
<div class="verse">The notion that acts are morally right and good,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
<div class="verse">That contribute to life as above understood.</div>
<div class="verse">In its thickness, breadth and length, all those things,</div>
<div class="verse">Which happiness achieve, diminishing man&#8217;s stings.</div>
<div class="verse">Before us examples have been set by teachers,</div>
<div class="verse">By Immanuel Kant better than preachers;</div>
<div class="verse">That each one of our actions should lofty be,</div>
<div class="verse">That each would be a model for a code of morality.</div>
<div class="verse">This form of hedonism I would gladly place</div>
<div class="verse">Before the eyes of the whole human race.</div>
<div class="verse">Asceticism is a term derived from the Greek,</div>
<div class="verse">Applied to monks, signifying the exercises they seek,</div>
<div class="verse">By which they distinguish themselves in that they do,</div>
<div class="verse">For favor with the deity in the lines they pursue,</div>
<div class="verse">Away from their fellow man as much as they can.</div>
<div class="verse">Virtue is a term originally meaning prowess,</div>
<div class="verse">And as applied to bravery they did possess;</div>
<div class="verse">It aroused the ancients to courage in distress.</div>
<div class="verse">When the Old Bard sang &#8220;the wrath</div>
<div class="verse">Of Peleus&#8217; son against those in his path;</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
<div class="verse">When his armies did advance with spear and lance,</div>
<div class="verse">Against the Trojans against whom he did advance;</div>
<div class="verse">Or of him sulking in his tent, nursing his spleen</div>
<div class="verse">Against tall Agamemnon for acts in being mean</div>
<div class="verse">Towards him in regard to a captive maid</div>
<div class="verse">Upon whom he had his affections laid.&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">And all the bloody deeds done by gods and men,</div>
<div class="verse">Breathing anger from their nostrils when</div>
<div class="verse">Upon each other their darts they did hurl,</div>
<div class="verse">And in the dust many bleeding bodies did curl;</div>
<div class="verse">As these savage men struggled for their prize;</div>
<div class="verse">To their gods whole hecatombs did they sacrifice</div>
<div class="verse">Of poor dumb brutes that could not sympathize</div>
<div class="verse">With them in their bloody wars and heroic cries.</div>
<div class="verse">Out of virtue as thus defined did arise</div>
<div class="verse">Asceticism and all the horrid tortures it did devise.</div>
<div class="verse">Even now men are so wedded to their inspired books</div>
<div class="verse">And things written in them by ancients where one looks</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
<div class="verse">To find every act for you and me so well defined</div>
<div class="verse">That they claim that all experience combined,</div>
<div class="verse">Cannot those precepts change to suit the age;</div>
<div class="verse">Although we point out inconsistency on every page.</div>
<div class="verse">They even allege that what by their book is said,</div>
<div class="verse">Makes things good or bad under each particular head.</div>
<div class="verse">That even as simple a thing as theft,</div>
<div class="verse">If out of their book the subject were left,</div>
<div class="verse">There would be nothing in our practical observation</div>
<div class="verse">To distinguish whether or not stealing was a proper avocation.</div>
<div class="verse">Whatever of man&#8217;s moral nature the origin may be,</div>
<div class="verse">Whether he was created with a certain propensity,</div>
<div class="verse">Or whether our tendencies are a matter of growth;</div>
<div class="verse">One thing is certain, and needs not any oath,</div>
<div class="verse">To prove that our several tastes may be improved,</div>
<div class="verse">To treat our fellow man as it him behoved;</div>
<div class="verse">And toward ourselves the truer to be,</div>
<div class="verse">Until our standards and the right did agree.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
<div class="verse">If all the acts that you and I must do,</div>
<div class="verse">Were written into mandates constantly held in view,</div>
<div class="verse">And we should follow them all the way through,</div>
<div class="verse">We still would be nothing but very slaves,</div>
<div class="verse">Marching under orders of some specially wise knaves.</div>
<div class="verse">Now if one in what he does, lives to the very top,</div>
<div class="verse">Of his own ideals, him we cannot stop,</div>
<div class="verse">Until for him his ideas we raise; he is up to full speed,</div>
<div class="verse">For the requirements of all are not if the same meed.</div>
<div class="verse">Most of man&#8217;s motions should be left to his whims,</div>
<div class="verse">Whether he rides or walks, or even swims.</div>
<div class="verse">Moral conduct being by each self imposed,</div>
<div class="verse">The acts men do will naturally be disclosed,</div>
<div class="verse">In the things they like in the tastes disclosed.</div>
<div class="verse">When the acts of men are ruled by laws enacted,</div>
<div class="verse">From the category of ethics they are subtracted.</div>
<div class="verse">No human motions should be forced or restrained,</div>
<div class="verse">Unless the welfare of others is to be attained.</div>
<div class="verse">In some general sense, everything I do,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
<div class="verse">To a limited extent, has its natural effect on you.</div>
<div class="verse">By two meeting in the road, one of us must turn,</div>
<div class="verse">To let the other pass or his rig might overturn.</div>
<div class="verse">By breathing the air some oxygen I must consume,</div>
<div class="verse">Also infecting what remains by what I exhume.</div>
<div class="verse">When in the market I buy my daily supplies,</div>
<div class="verse">That alone has a tendency to make the price rise;</div>
<div class="verse">So that you have to pay more for your store.</div>
<div class="verse">Thus in many and varied ways our motions bear</div>
<div class="verse">Some natural disadvantages we should all share,</div>
<div class="verse">In our relations each with each as we live everywhere.</div>
<div class="verse">Any physical fact, however simple it may look,</div>
<div class="verse">May change aspect by the turns it took,</div>
<div class="verse">Showing how the morality of any motion,</div>
<div class="verse">May appear and disappear, simply by the notion</div>
<div class="verse">We have about those unseen motives in its track</div>
<div class="verse">Preceding, going with, or following it back.</div>
<div class="verse">In presence of ladies a man takes off his hat,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
<div class="verse">To show respect for them and nothing but that.</div>
<div class="verse">The morality of this act is not hard to adjust.</div>
<div class="verse">The same gentleman to brush away the dust,</div>
<div class="verse">Takes off the same hat in perfect disgust.</div>
<div class="verse">In each case the taking off the hat was in view.</div>
<div class="verse">The one act was moral, while the other it&#8217;s true,</div>
<div class="verse">With the question of ethics had nothing to do.</div>
<div class="verse">He now takes off his hat at the command of the law,</div>
<div class="verse">In the presence of the court where he waits in awe.</div>
<div class="verse">Being tired of the hat, he takes it off to sell,</div>
<div class="verse">Now the above illustration you know so well,</div>
<div class="verse">That its application I&#8217;ll leave you to spell.</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Nothing&#8217;s good or bad but the thinking makes it so.&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">Behold the beauty of ethics, let us make it grow.</div>
<div class="verse">If you want plants to thrive, cultivate the soil,</div>
<div class="verse">Don&#8217;t over fertilize, or you will make them spoil.</div>
<div class="verse">We may stimulate our desires for good morals,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
<div class="verse">And our desire for good deeds, even by quarrels.</div>
<div class="verse">We may over stimulate the passions of the youth,</div>
<div class="verse">Even when trying upon them to impress the truth.</div>
<div class="verse">By unduly stimulating their appetite for gains,</div>
<div class="verse">And their desires for pleasures without enduring the pains;</div>
<div class="verse">And by excess their natures may be changed.</div>
<div class="verse">In that way we destroy their faculty to enjoy,</div>
<div class="verse">The real blessings of life born of strife.</div>
<div class="verse">Rewards and punishments for acts and omissions,</div>
<div class="verse">Are causes for delinquencies and its commissions.</div>
<div class="verse">Both have their way their victims to sway,</div>
<div class="verse">From the natural paths of right every day.</div>
<div class="verse">Every good act brings its consequential pay</div>
<div class="verse">And every wrong act its own punishment,</div>
<div class="verse">Upon all who upon mischief are always bent.</div>
<div class="verse">But to add to the natural consequence of things,</div>
<div class="verse">Which their performance usually brings,</div>
<div class="verse">This over pay in the nature of rewards,</div>
<div class="verse">Drives one on until the pay alone he regards,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
<div class="verse">And the nature of crimes fades out of view,</div>
<div class="verse">While the punishment alone is considered by you.</div>
<div class="verse">Thus on we are naturally driven from our path,</div>
<div class="verse">Straying out of the right and the pleasures it hath.</div>
<div class="verse">Most of our motions should be left open to choice</div>
<div class="verse">To develop our selective faculties in acts and voice,</div>
<div class="verse">That make us kind and fellows to rejoice.</div>
<div class="verse">A certain kind of approval we feel,</div>
<div class="verse">That might be compared to the scent flowers yield,</div>
<div class="verse">Upon the doing or even contemplation of acts.</div>
<div class="verse">There is also a stifling sensation coming about,</div>
<div class="verse">The doing of things about which there is a doubt,</div>
<div class="verse">As to whether we ought, although never found out,</div>
<div class="verse">Think, do, or pursue the thing we&#8217;re about.</div>
<div class="verse">Conscience is the name applied</div>
<div class="verse">To this moving feeling with our faculties allied.</div>
<div class="verse">And some say it is a true moral guide.</div>
<div class="verse">But experience finds conscience in this plight,</div>
<div class="verse">It approves everything we think to be right,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
<div class="verse">And condemns all things in our sight,</div>
<div class="verse">That even from ignorance we deem wrong that may be right.</div>
<div class="verse">For conscience&#8217; sake many have been burned at the stake,</div>
<div class="verse">To appease its gnawings, and thirst for blood to slake.</div>
<div class="verse">Gored by its pricks, Hindu mothers, their own babes,</div>
<div class="verse">In innocence swathed, into the seething waves,</div>
<div class="verse">Of the River Ganges, writhing, religiously they fling,</div>
<div class="verse">While to this river god their hymns they sing,</div>
<div class="verse">Galled by conscience the monk and anchorite,</div>
<div class="verse">In dark caves, out of human sight,</div>
<div class="verse">Tear their flesh and do themselves every spite</div>
<div class="verse">To humiliate themselves in heaven&#8217;s sight.</div>
<div class="verse">What a freak conscience has proved to be,</div>
<div class="verse">Is illustrated in a story by Heinrich Heine,</div>
<div class="verse">Of a certain judge in a certain state,</div>
<div class="verse">Having condemned eight hundred by his mandate,</div>
<div class="verse">To be burned at the stake for witchcraft,</div>
<div class="verse">One day conscience threw at him its own shaft.</div>
<div class="verse">He imagined too that he was guilty of the crime,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
<div class="verse">That so many others had been during his time.</div>
<div class="verse">So to quiet his conscience he paid the fine;</div>
<div class="verse">And having declared himself guilty, did resign,</div>
<div class="verse">And purge his soul in punishment condign.</div>
<div class="verse">Conscience may help us our morals to regulate,</div>
<div class="verse">But first of all, we must our conscience educate,</div>
<div class="verse">By educating the head by which it is led.</div>
<div class="verse">Know the right and do it too as best you can</div>
<div class="verse">And conscience will aid you to be a man.</div>
<div class="verse">To learn the right, and it pursue,</div>
<div class="verse">Read all books and observe the actions of man,</div>
<div class="verse">Acquire by your own experience all you can;</div>
<div class="verse">Value conduct as you would value your goods,</div>
<div class="verse">Digest the subject as you do your foods,</div>
<div class="verse">Always keeping in view that present good,</div>
<div class="verse">Is often best achieved, when understood,</div>
<div class="verse">By enduring pains now to prepare us for pleasures,</div>
<div class="verse">In the days to come in greater measures.</div>
<div class="verse">After all, the art which makes life a success</div>
<div class="verse">In blessing those we love to bless,</div>
<div class="verse">Is to find th&#8217; equilibrium of pleasures and pains,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
<div class="verse">As we do our business losses and gains.</div>
<div class="verse">Altruism is a word by Auguste Compte made,</div>
<div class="verse">Meaning regard for others, which he truly said,</div>
<div class="verse">We should cultivate and human love assimilate.</div>
<div class="verse">Sometimes the best thing for others we can do,</div>
<div class="verse">Is not to worry them, but our own course pursue,</div>
<div class="verse">And to ourselves be true, and they&#8217;ll pull through.</div>

<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="antiqua">Sunday Laws</span></h2>
</div>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Having enjoyed our quarrels, before we pause,</div>
<div class="verse">Let us take a look at your Sunday laws.</div>
<div class="verse">In olden time Sabbath breaking was a crime</div>
<div class="verse">Of such deep hue, that if anything you do</div>
<div class="verse">On that blessed day, even to earn a dime,</div>
<div class="verse">By shoveling snow, just about the time,</div>
<div class="verse">You begin to know that you must explore</div>
<div class="verse">For a little bread to keep wolf from your door.</div>
<div class="verse">Now the reason they did pense, for making that offense,</div>
<div class="verse">As I divine the most heinous of their time;</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
<div class="verse">Was, that of all the days, it only took six,</div>
<div class="verse">For God the funds to raise and no plans to mix,</div>
<div class="verse">To build heaven and earth and all stars to fix;</div>
<div class="verse">And that the job was all finished so good,</div>
<div class="verse">By sundown Saturday night, as they understood,</div>
<div class="verse">That on Sunday He had nothing left to do;</div>
<div class="verse">So the Lord had to rest, and now must you.</div>
<div class="verse">If mistaken in the reasons as to me it looks,</div>
<div class="verse">Plenty of Sunday laws are found in your statute books;</div>
<div class="verse">And you can read them all yourself,</div>
<div class="verse">By taking them off their shelf.</div>
<div class="verse">But all those laws have now grown so very old,</div>
<div class="verse">And all the pages that them do hold,</div>
<div class="verse">Are all stuck together with moss and rust,</div>
<div class="verse">So that if you really and truly must,</div>
<div class="verse">Take a look at them yourself to see if they are just,</div>
<div class="verse">It would be better to hire some old maid or hag,</div>
<div class="verse">Who would supply herself with a dust brush and rag</div>
<div class="verse">From their pages to scrub away the mold of decay.</div>
<div class="verse">Every few years, say one in ten,</div>
<div class="verse">Some one or two of our fanatic men,</div>
<div class="verse">Or some great big oratorical fellow,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
<div class="verse">Who imagines that with all ease he can bellow,</div>
<div class="verse">And scare the boys their toys to put away,</div>
<div class="verse">On the holy, blessed Sabbath day.</div>
<div class="verse">As once happened in my own native state,</div>
<div class="verse">In almost a comparatively modern date.</div>
<div class="verse">This oratorical man became prosecutor of the law;</div>
<div class="verse">And he began in earnest to apply his jaw.</div>
<div class="verse">He gave us such a jar, that it was hard a cigar,</div>
<div class="verse">Or even a loaf of bread to get near or far.</div>
<div class="verse">Finally this one did his feathers plume,</div>
<div class="verse">And a race for Congress he began to assume;</div>
<div class="verse">Thinking that trip he could easily fly.</div>
<div class="verse">We then commenced to sing &#8220;as in days gone by,&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">Before he was walking about our doors stalking,</div>
<div class="verse">Upon our heads to precipitate his wrath,</div>
<div class="verse">To keep us all in the old straight and narrow path.</div>
<div class="verse">In not such an awfully long time, we awoke to find,</div>
<div class="verse">That by somebody&#8217;s nudge, our man was criminal judge.</div>
<div class="verse">Dead sure now was he that he could scare all the boys away</div>
<div class="verse">From everything that looked like work or even play,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
<div class="verse">On the Sabbath day, and being in the lurch,</div>
<div class="verse">Haply a number would stumble into church,</div>
<div class="verse">When the choir began to sing and the coin to ring</div>
<div class="verse">In the collection box handed around by a sly fox.</div>
<div class="verse">Criminal informations for men in every station,</div>
<div class="verse">Who in his estimation, were the Sabbath breaking,</div>
<div class="verse">And the church forsaking, issued from his court,</div>
<div class="verse">Patiently did the folks go their bails,</div>
<div class="verse">And barely kept them out of our jails,</div>
<div class="verse">Till the humane change of venue came:</div>
<div class="verse">Then alas for his fame, nothing but blame,</div>
<div class="verse">For his services lent, and the people&#8217;s money spent.</div>
<div class="verse">By simple non-use laws may die, in the public eye.</div>
<div class="verse">When they go out of date, there is no need to legislate;</div>
<div class="verse">They are always considered as off the slate.</div>
<div class="verse">So let all our captives out with joy and glee,</div>
<div class="verse">And let us learn one thing from the Man of Galilee,</div>
<div class="verse">That the Sabbath was made for man.</div>

<div class="verse">To work and love and live and do</div>

<div class="verse">Would be a good religion for me and for you.</div>
<div class="verse">To help ourselves and others to educate,</div>
<div class="verse">That all false pride, selfishness and hate,</div>

<div class="verse">Nor those long drawn out sighs we heave;</div>
<div class="verse">Nor even the sorrow we feel for crimes,</div>
<div class="verse">Committed away back in ancient times,</div>
<div class="verse">By Adam and Eve among their vines</div>
<div class="verse">Of the lovely Garden of Eden</div>
<div class="verse">Where before there was not a weed in.</div>
<div class="verse">Go to church if you please, don your bonnet and hike,</div>
<div class="verse">Take a front seat or sit with the choir if you like,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
<div class="verse">Invite others too, but don&#8217;t frown if they do</div>
<div class="verse">Let you go by yourself if they want you.</div>

<div class="verse">To heave at him while down, your pious lance;</div>
<div class="verse">Put your arms around his neck, his pains to check,</div>
<div class="verse">And take some other time his sins to inspect.</div>
<div class="verse">Put your money in the missionary field,</div>
<div class="verse">To send to all China and all around you feel,</div>
<div class="verse">Like saving them from their idols to whom they kneel;</div>
<div class="verse">Spread yourself on land and sea to get them in the band;</div>
<div class="verse">All this you do and have not charity,</div>
<div class="verse">And your religion is not right for me.</div>
<div class="verse">Cut out Sunday, sin, satan and hell,</div>
<div class="verse">Leave the gods up where they are wont to dwell;</div>
<div class="verse">Change all of your songs about heaven above</div>
<div class="verse">To things upon our earth and human love;</div>
<div class="verse">Put off your mourning, lugubrious whine</div>
<div class="verse">And think of man as the one divine;</div>
<div class="verse">Learn to talk and walk and act</div>
<div class="verse">As if man&#8217;s freedom was a real fact.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
<div class="verse">Let your parsons take off their gowns,</div>
<div class="verse">And smooth out all their wrinkly frowns;</div>

<div class="verse">Let deacons and monks and all their crew,</div>

<div class="verse">Stop talking about inspired books and creeds,</div>
<div class="verse">But show your faith by human thoughts and deeds.</div>
<div class="verse">Immaculate conception and total depravity,</div>
<div class="verse">Are entirely too heavy for mortal&#8217;s gravity;</div>
<div class="verse">Baptism, holy unction, and the new birth divine,</div>
<div class="verse">Are elements in which gods alone may shine.</div>
<div class="verse">All our superstitions and fears and shame,</div>
<div class="verse">Originate in reverence for some holy name,</div>
<div class="verse">Burned into man by torch, faggot and flame.</div>
<div class="verse">Prophets, priests and seers of old,</div>
<div class="verse">So long their marvellous tales have told,</div>

<div class="verse">A doubt against them dare to hold.</div>
<div class="verse">Their ancient books and maps and charts,</div>

<div class="verse">From childhood hour at chime of bell</div>
<div class="verse">All congregate to hear the preacher tell</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
<div class="verse">Of the garden of Eden where the serpent bold,</div>
<div class="verse">To our first mother did his story unfold;</div>
<div class="verse">And, that fascinated by that shiny snake,</div>
<div class="verse">She has doomed us all to the burning lake,</div>
<div class="verse">With no water our scorching thirst to slake.</div>
<div class="verse">He tells us too with all his might and main,</div>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Death always strikes with a terrific blow,</div>
<div class="verse">Because it drives us to where we do not know.</div>
<div class="verse">All the saddened past has been filled with a guess.</div>
<div class="verse">Ages have been spent in trying to relieve its distress.</div>
<div class="verse">Men have sought magic and the spells it casts</div>
<div class="verse">To answer questions and all inquiries of death asked.</div>
<div class="verse">Yet, after all, we simply know that it is the fate</div>
<div class="verse">We all must equally share with those we love or hate.</div>
<div class="verse">Life is but a short story for us when it is told;</div>
<div class="verse">Its brief animation for the young and for the old</div>
<div class="verse">Is only an agitation, a ripple on the waves of time.</div>
<div class="verse">A few joys, a few sorrows, a few thoughts sublime</div>
<div class="verse">As onward we speed into the Great Beyond unknown.</div>
<div class="verse">Could we but open the doors and see the paths strown</div>
<div class="verse">With all the remains of the billions before us thrown</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
<div class="verse">Into the gaping jaws of death, devouring its own,</div>
<div class="verse">We might then unravel its mysteries deep,</div>
<div class="verse">We might then have visions of those who sleep;</div>
<div class="verse">But into that vast chasm none are allowed to peep.</div>
<div class="verse">Vain it is to pry into this oblivion profound,</div>
<div class="verse">Vain to attempt its hidden meaning to expound;</div>
<div class="verse">Vain to ask why the hungry jaws of this Monster Great</div>
<div class="verse">Does not spare our loved ones, why he should immolate</div>
<div class="verse">Kings in palaces and peasants in huts of want,</div>
<div class="verse">Babes in cradles and aged ones lean and gaunt.</div>
<div class="verse">If we are inevitably doomed to this common end;</div>

<div class="verse">We must meet it, and with its pangs must cope.</div>
<div class="verse">In which ever way our winding paths may lead</div>
<div class="verse">Death faces us with its devastating looks of greed.</div>
<div class="verse">It comes to us in a thousand different ways;</div>
<div class="verse">It visits us at night when the sun has hid its rays;</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
<div class="verse">It greets us at noonday when the sun is high;</div>
<div class="verse">No one can escape its ever-vigilant eye;</div>
<div class="verse">All the living must yield up to it and die.</div>
<div class="verse">Is death a curse, then all the living are cursed;</div>
<div class="verse">Is death a blessing, then all the living will be blessed.</div>
<div class="verse">It cannot be an evil, nature creates nothing wrong;</div>
<div class="verse">And it is only nature while we follow it along.</div>
<div class="verse">Mother earth brings us all into this life;</div>
<div class="verse">And this same mother calls us back from its strife.</div>
<div class="verse">Can it be that our mother would be unkind?</div>
<div class="verse">In a universal mother, universal love we find.</div>
<div class="verse">Although her children be numbered by millions;</div>
<div class="verse">And all her numberless offspring run into billions;</div>
<div class="verse">Yet no partiality she shows; all are treated the same;</div>
<div class="verse">Her rules are based on fate, break them and bear the blame.</div>
<div class="verse">How could her laws be varied to suit her flock?</div>
<div class="verse">Anarchy would reign and destroy her stock.</div>
<div class="verse">One universal law; death waits us all;</div>
<div class="verse">So let us be courageous while we wait its call.</div>
